We evaluated BSGI, mammography and pathologic reports of 89 patients with invasive breast cancers. 87.6% were visible on BSGI. Cancer in old or postmenopausal women were more visible on BSGI (p?=?0.003, 0.046). Cancers????1.0?cm in size were significantly more visible on BSGI than those <1?cm in size (p?=?0.002). Cancers in fatty breasts were more visible than those in dense breasts (p?=?0.042). Invasive cancers in older, postmenopausal patients, cancers with size ??1.0?cm, and those with fatty breast are better visualized by BSGI, than those in younger, premenopausal patients, with size <1.0?cm and dense breast.",breast_neoplasms
29853749,"Skin cancer is the most common other primary cancer in patients with lymphoma. However, an intriguing association between cutaneous lymphoma and other primary cancers has been suggested in a few studies. This study investigated other primary cancers in patients with cutaneous lymphoma to evaluate the risk for occurrence of each type of cancer. We screened for other primary cancers in 428 patients with cutaneous lymphoma. Clinical features were analyzed according to the lineage and origin of the lymphomas. We calculated the standardized incidence ratio with statistical analysis for each group according to age. Among 330 patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma and 98 with cutaneous B cell lymphoma, a total of 43 cancers in 38 patients were finally included. Other primary cancers were prevalent in patients with cutaneous B cell lymphoma and patients with secondary cutaneous lymphoma. However, those differences were not significant when the age was calibrated by multiple logistic regression. Metachronously higher standardized incidence ratios were observed for primary lung (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 14.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.05~39.54), skin (SIR, 68.05; 95% CI, 14.03~181.62), and breast (SIR, 12.91; 95% CI, 1.56~41.41) cancers with statistical significance. Other primary cancers more preferentially occurred in patients with cutaneous lymphoma. Clinicians should carefully examine patients with cutaneous lymphoma for other cancers, especially lung, skin, and breast cancers.",breast_neoplasms
29808426,"To assess patterns of parenchymal tissue on mammography in women with dense breasts and to determine how this varies with age and affects recall to assessment and cancer diagnosis. Breast density data was obtained in women attending routine mammographic screening from April 2013 to March 2015 using automated breast density assessment software. Women with the densest breasts were selected for visual interpretation of parenchymal pattern (PP). One hundred non-assessed women, aged 50, 55, 60, 65 and 69-71 years (total = 500), provided controls. Cases included women recalled for assessment (mastectomy or implants excluded) (total = 280). Mammograms reviewed by ten readers and PP classified as: (1) very smooth; (2) mainly smooth; (3) mixed; (4) mainly nodular; (5) very nodular. The ratio of women in each category at each age and screening outcomes were compared by Pearson's chi-squared test. Reader agreement for scoring PP was good (intraclass correlation = 0.6302). Proportions of women in each PP category were similar at all ages for controls (p = 0.147) and cases (p = 0.657). The ratio of PP categories did not vary significantly with age in those who underwent biopsy (p = 0.484). Thirty-four cancers were diagnosed. There was a significant correlation between a diagnosis of cancer and nodular PP compared to not nodular PP (p = 0.043). The ratio of smooth to nodular pattern in women with the densest breasts did not vary with age. The PP of the breast tissue did not affect likelihood of recall to assessment or biopsy. There was a significant relationship between a nodular parenchymal pattern and diagnosis of cancer. ? This paper shows that there is good agreement between mammogram readers when classifying mammographic PP on a five-point scale from very smooth to very nodular. ? In non-assessed women with the densest breasts, there is no significant change in the proportions of smooth to nodular patterns with increasing age. ? The likelihood of recall for further assessment or biopsy at assessment is not related to PP in women with highest breast density. ? When recalled for further assessment, significantly more women are diagnosed with cancer in the group with nodular PP on mammography when compared with smooth and mixed patterns.",breast_neoplasms
29801187,"Rehabilitation programs that support return to work become increasingly relevant for cancer survivors. In Germany, such programs were established as work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR). The study investigated whether WMR leads to better results compared to medical rehabilitation (MR). We report effects on secondary outcomes when the rehabilitation program was completed. Clusters of participants were randomly assigned to WMR or MR. Patients of working age and an elevated risk of not returning to work were included. The grade of implementation was assessed by dose delivered and dose received. Study outcomes were assessed using scales measuring functioning and symptoms, coping with illness as well as self-reported work ability. Treatment effects were estimated using mixed linear models. From 232 planned randomized intervention groups, 165 (71%) were realized. In total, 476 patients were included. Mean age of participants was 50.7 years (SD=7.3). Most frequent primary diagnoses were malignant neoplasms of the breast. Participants in the WMR program reported significantly better outcomes regarding quality of life (SMD=0.17-0.25), fatigue (SMD=0.18-0.27), coping with illness (SMD=0.17-0.22), and self-reported work-ability (SMD=0.16) compared to participants in MR program (all p<0.05).

29788687,"Breast reconstruction has become more common as mastectomy has become more frequent. In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) began covering breast reconstruction in April 2015. This study aimed to investigate trends in mastectomy and breast reconstruction over the past 10 years and to evaluate the impact of NHIS coverage on breast reconstruction. Nationwide data regarding mastectomy and breast reconstruction were collected from the Korean Breast Cancer Society registry database. Multiple variables were analyzed in the records of patients who underwent breast reconstruction from January 2005 to March 2017 at a single institution. At Seoul National University Hospital, the total number of reconstruction cases increased 13-fold from 2005 to 2016. The proportion of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) cases out of all cases of total mastectomy increased from 4% in 2005 to 52.0% in 2016. The proportion of delayed breast reconstruction (DBR) cases out of all cases of breast reconstruction and the overall number of DBR cases increased from 8.8% (20 cases) in 2012 to 18.3% (76 cases) in 2016. After NHIS coverage was initiated, the proportions of IBR and DBR showed statistically significant increases (P<0.05). Among the IBR cases, the percentage of prosthesis-based reconstructions increased significantly (P<0.05), but this trend was not found with DBR. Total mastectomy became significantly more common after the expansion of NHIS coverage (P<0.05). Over the last decade, there has been an increase in mastectomy and breast reconstruction, and the pace of increase accelerated after the expansion of NHIS coverage. It is expected that breast reconstruction will be a routine option for patients with breast cancer under the NHIS.",breast_neoplasms
29778463,"Urinary 8-isoprostane is an established biomarker for lipid peroxidation. However, the association between its pre-diagnostic levels and cancer incidence has rarely been evaluated. 8793 older adults from the German ESTHER cohort were followed up for cancer incidence by cancer registry data. A directed acyclic graph was utilized to identify potential confounders. Multivariate Cox regression models were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During 14-year follow-up, 1540 incident cancer cases, including 207 lung, 196 colorectal, 218 breast and 245 prostate cancer cases were detected. 8-isoprostane concentrations were positively associated with lung cancer, but not with cancer at the other sites. The HR (95% CI) for the association with lung cancer was 1.61 (1.10, 2.34) for comparison of the top with bottom tertile in total population. The association of 8-isoprostane levels with lung cancer persisted after the adjustment for smoking and other potential confounders and was multiplicative to the effect of smoking. However, 8-isoprostane levels did not improve lung cancer prediction when added to a model containing age, sex and smoking. A protective association of increasing 8-isoprostane levels was observed for prostate cancer incidence but this association was only statistically significant among current smokers. Our findings suggest that lipid peroxidation is involved in the development of lung cancer. However, high oxidative stress may be a protective factor for prostate cancer, especially among current smokers.",breast_neoplasms

29768351,"Recently, several high-quality clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have identified that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 inhibitors obtained a great safety and efficacy, which can be consequently applied as a combination therapy with letrozole or fulvestrant for women who had advanced breast cancer and progressed while receiving endocrine therapy. In this systemic review, we performed a meta-analysis to explore whether CDK4/6 inhibitors had a significantly benefit to treating hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-negative) advanced breast cancer. The data for meta-analysis were collected from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from January 1980 to December 2017, and eventually 3182 patients from 6 RCTs were included. The result showed the CDK4/6 inhibitor group had a longer progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio?=?0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.57, P < .00001), a better objective response (risk rate?=?1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74, P < .00001), as well as a better clinical benefit response (risk rate?=?1.29; 95% CI, 1.13-1.47, P?=?.0001). Besides, subgroup analyses of PFS according to stratification factors and other baseline characteristics confirmed a great performance of CDK4/6 inhibitors across the all subgroups. And sensitive analysis showed that all outcomes were stable except Finn 2014 trail. CDK4/6 inhibitors can significantly prolong the PFS and improve the objective response and clinical benefit response among the patients with HR-positive/ HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

The panel of markers was chosen based on the histomorphology on H and E sections. IHC was done in cases with an unknown primary where paraffin blocks were available. Lung cancer was found to be the most common primary malignancy (n = 30; 48.4%) followed by breast cancer (n = 13; 21%), colorectal cancer (n = 6; 9.6%), and skin cancer (melanoma) [n = 3; 4.8%].

First, the most valid single measurement location was determined by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient relative to the reference test. Second, to evaluate the responsiveness to change over four time points, outcomes of the selected single measurement and the reference test were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA. Third, area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity of the selected single measurement site (index test).

29751773,"Desmoid-type fibromatoses are rare benign and fibrous tumors that account for approximately 0.03% of total neoplasms. Within this category of neoplasms, pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis is an extremely rare subgroup, accounting for approximately 5% of desmoid-type fibromatoses. Although the etiology is unknown, some risk factors include trauma, surgery, family history of desmoid tumor, pregnancy, use of contraceptives, genetic mutation, and familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner syndrome. Desmoid-type tumors are primarily diagnosed by pathological and immunohistochemical studies. The treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor. Systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are optional treatment approaches for patients with high risk for surgery. The following is a report of an unusual case of a pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis in which a very rare variation in the immunohistochemistry findings was demonstrated: slides were immunopositive for S100 protein and not immunonegative. Most desmoid tumors are immunonegative for S100 protein with just a few cases being positive for this protein. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy, a Chinese national, who was diagnosed as having a pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis. He was a healthy individual who was incidentally diagnosed with an abdominal mass. His chief complaints were mild generalized abdominal pain for 1 week, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. An enhanced computed tomography scan of his abdomen showed a large cystic mass in the anterior surface of the body of his pancreas. He underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic mass, partial pancreatectomy, splenectomy, segmental resection of transverse colon and distal jejunum, and subsequently a one-stage jejunojejunostomy and colonic anastomosis. Postoperatively, he was diagnosed as having a desmoid-type fibromatosis of the pancreas by pathological and immunohistochemical studies. The diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis is usually incidental and challenging. Pathological and immunohistochemical testing are essential for confirming diagnosis where demonstration of ??-catenin nuclear staining is probably the single most important characteristic. Other markers, such as vimentin, are usually positive, while S100 protein is usually negative. Our case however, confirms that there are rare cases that can be S100 positive. This is the first diagnosed case of pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis with S100 protein positivity.",breast_neoplasms

Spindle cell carcinoma (SPC) is a subtype of MBC with a predominant spindle cell component. The patient was a 52-year-old female with invasive ductal breast carcinoma who underwent a modified radical mastectomy and an axillary node dissection. A new lump was observed underneath the surgical site between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles 45 days after the patient underwent sequential postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It was speculated that the new lesion had developed during postoperative adjuvant therapy. And the new lesion was regarded as a recurrence. We performed a wide dissection of the tumor with negative margins. The pathology of the tumor indicated SPC. Then, the patient received chemotherapy and demonstrated a poor response. Local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis developed shortly afterwards, and the patient succumbed to the disease within 5 months. Local recurrence with metaplastic SPC transformed from invasive ductal breast carcinoma during postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is rare. The failure of subsequent chemotherapy and the progression of disease indicate the aggressive nature of SPC and its decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

We sought to assemble publicly available data from Africa to provide estimates of the incidence of breast cancer on the continent. A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, Global Health and African Journals Online (AJOL) was conducted. We included population- or hospital-based registry studies on breast cancer conducted in Africa, and providing estimates of the crude incidence of breast cancer among women. A random effects meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled incidence of breast cancer across studies. The literature search returned 4648 records, with 41 studies conducted across 54 study sites in 22 African countries selected. We observed important variations in reported cancer incidence between population- and hospital-based cancer registries. The overall pooled crude incidence of breast cancer from population-based registries was 24.5 per 100?000 person years (95% confidence interval (CI) 20.1-28.9). The incidence in North Africa was higher at 29.3 per 100?000 (95% CI 20.0-38.7) than Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at 22.4 per 100?000 (95% CI 17.2-28.0). In hospital-based registries, the overall pooled crude incidence rate was estimated at 23.6 per 100?000 (95% CI 18.5-28.7). SSA and Northern Africa had relatively comparable rates at 24.0 per 100?000 (95% CI 17.5-30.4) and 23.2 per 100?000 (95% CI 6.6-39.7), respectively. Across both registries, incidence rates increased considerably between 2000 and 2015. The available evidence suggests a growing incidence of breast cancer in Africa. The representativeness of these estimates is uncertain due to the paucity of data in several countries and calendar years, as well as inconsistency in data collation and quality across existing cancer registries.",breast_neoplasms

This is a HIPAA-compliant IRB approved retrospective study. Patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative operable invasive ductal carcinoma and preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were consecutively included between 2005 and 2009. The parenchyma of the breast contralateral to known cancer was segmented automatically on MRI and contralateral parenchymal enhancement (CPE) was calculated. CPE was split into tertiles and tested for association with invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and overall survival (OS). Propensity score analysis with inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust CPE for patient and tumour characteristics as well as systemic therapy. Three hundred and two patients were included. The median age at diagnosis was 48 years (interquartile range, 42-57). Median follow-up was 88 months (interquartile range, 76-102); 15/302 (5%) patients died and 37/302 (13%) had a recurrence or died. In context of multivariable analysis, IPW-adjusted CPE was associated with IDFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05-0.68, p = 0.004] and OS (HR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.00-0.83, p = 0.032). Contralateral parenchymal enhancement on pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI as an independent biomarker of survival in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer has been upheld in this study.

The finding of an unexpected region of FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) uptake can occur when performing whole-body FDG-PET, raising the possibility of a second primary tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience of second primary cancer incidentally discovered during PET/CT examination performed for pancreatic diseases, during the initial work-up or follow-up after surgical resection. In this study, a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collected data base was performed. Three hundred ninety- nine patients with pancreatic pathology were evaluated by whole body PET/CT imaging from January 2004 to December 2014. Among them, 348 patients were scanned before surgical resection and 51 during the course of their follow-up (pancreatic cancer). Median follow-up time was 29?months (range 14-124). Fifty-six patients (14%) had incidental uptake of FDG in their organs: 31 patients had focal uptake and 25 showed diffuse with or without focal uptake. All patients with focal uptake were investigated, and invasive malignancy was diagnosed in 22 patients: 14 colon, 4 lung, 1 larynx, 1 urothelial, 1 breast cancer, and 1 colon metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Twenty patients underwent resection, and 6 endoscopic removal of colonic polyps. Three patients were not operated for advanced disease, and two patients did not show any pathology (PET/CT false positive). Of the 10 patients investigated for diffuse uptake, no malignancy was found; none of these patients developed a second cancer during the follow-up. As in other malignancies, unexpected FDG uptake can occur in patients having PET/CT investigation for pancreatic diseases. Focal uptake is likely to be a malignancy and deserves further investigations, although the stage and the poor prognosis of primary pancreatic cancer should be kept in mind.

29715108,"Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) level increases with tumor grade, and elevated serum IL-6 correlates with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes are associated with enhanced metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Therefore, we examined whether IL-6 induced EMT phenotype characterized in breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells treated with different concentrations (10-50 ng/ml) of IL-6 for 24 and 48 h. Western blotting, flow cytometry, and cell migration assay were used to test whether IL-6 promoted tumor-initiating ability in MCF-7 cells. In this study, we found that the induction of EMT by IL-6 resulted in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and the increase of tumor-initiating ability in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we found that 2-phenylnaphthy-ridin-4-one derivatives were able to repress IL-6 induced EMT phenotype and tumor-initiating ability. Among these deriveratives, LYF-11 possessed the most potential inhibitory activity. LYF-11 effectively inhibited IL-6-induced EMT phenotype and tumor-initiating ability via the inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our results suggest a connection between IL-6 receptor activity and EMT phenotype, and tumor-initiating ability. Moreover, LYF-11 is a potential compound for breast cancer therapy by targeting JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.",breast_neoplasms
29715105,"The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) is considered as one of the most well-characterized tumor-associated antigens for cancer therapy and plays an important role in the growth and progression of breast cancer. Overexpression of HER2 in various cancers and the availability of its extracellular region makes it a clinically useful target for the development of tumor-antigen specific agents. In this study, we have prepared a HER2-targeted hybrid peptide as a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging probe and evaluated its tumor targeting potential in subcutaneous HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft models. 99mTc-HER2 were evaluated in HER2-positive (SKBR3) and ER-positive (MCF7 and T47D) breast cancer cell lines. In vivo tumor targeting characteristics were investigated in both SKBR3 (HER2-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2-negative) xenografted animal models. 99mTc-HER2 was found in most of the major organs excluding the kidneys in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice. 99mTc-HER2-targeted peptide may be a promising tumor imaging probe and warrants further investigation.",breast_neoplasms
29715090,"In breast cancer (BC) care, radiation therapy (RT) is an efficient treatment to control localized tumor. Radiobiological research is needed to understand molecular differences that affect radiosensitivity of different tumor subtypes and the response variability. The aim of this study was to analyze gene expression profiling (GEP) in primary BC cells following irradiation with doses of 9 Gy and 23 Gy delivered by intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) in order to define gene signatures of response to high doses of ionizing radiation. We performed GEP by cDNA microarrays and evaluated cell survival after IOERT treatment in primary BC cell cultures. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate candidate genes. We showed, for the first time, a 4-gene and a 6-gene signature, as new molecular biomarkers, in two primary BC cell cultures after exposure at 9 Gy and 23 Gy respectively, for which we observed a significantly high survival rate. Gene signatures activated by different doses of ionizing radiation may predict response to RT and contribute to defining a personalized biological-driven treatment plan.",breast_neoplasms

Mammography quality of a random sample of screen-film mammograms was evaluated by an expert radiologist following the criteria of the Canadian Association of Radiologists. For each screening examination, scores ranging from 1 (poor quality) to 5 (excellent quality) were attributed for positioning, compression, contrast, exposure level, sharpness, and artifacts. A final overall quality score (lower or higher) was also given. Poisson regression models with robust estimation of variance and adjusted for potential confounding factors were used to assess associations of mammography quality with the FP rate. Among 1,209 women without cancer, there were 104 (8.6%) FPs. Lower overall mammography quality is associated with an increase in the FP rate (risk ratio [RR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.1; P?=?.07) but this increase was not statistically significant. Artifacts were associated with an increase in the FP rate (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.3; P?=?.01) whereas lower quality of exposure level was related to a reduction of the FP rate (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-1.0; P?=?.01). Lower quality scores for all other quality attributes were related to a nonstatistically significant increase in the FP rate of 10%-30%. Artifacts can have a substantial effect on the FP rate. The effect of overall mammography quality on the FP rate may also be substantial and needs to be clarified.",breast_neoplasms

To compare local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months in adults and children undergoing elective surgery. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to December 2016 without any language restriction. We used a combination of free text search and controlled vocabulary search. We limited results to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We updated this search in December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We conducted a handsearch in reference lists of included studies, review articles and conference abstracts. We searched the PROSPERO systematic review registry for related systematic reviews. We included RCTs comparing local or regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia with a pain outcome beyond three months after elective, non-orthopaedic surgery. At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data and adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. We presented outcomes as pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), based on random-effects models (inverse variance method). We analysed studies separately by surgical intervention, but pooled outcomes reported at different follow-up intervals. We compared our results to Bayesian and classical (frequentist) models. We investigated heterogeneity. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. In this updated review, we identified 40 new RCTs and seven ongoing studies. In total, we included 63 RCTs in the review, but we were only able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months after surgery from 41 studies, enrolling a total of 3143 participants in our inclusive analysis.Evidence synthesis of seven RCTs favoured epidural anaesthesia for thoracotomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thoracotomy were 0.52 compared to not having an epidural (OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Simlarly, evidence synthesis of 18 RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, 1297 participants, low-quality evidence). Pooling data at three to 8 months after surgery from four RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia after caesarean section with an OR of 0.46, (95% CI 0.28 to 0.78; 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis of three RCTs investigating continuous infusion with local anaesthetic for the prevention of PPP three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (ICBG) was inconclusive (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09; 123 participants, low-quality evidence). However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion of intravenous local anaesthetics for the prevention of PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence).We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery and laparotomy. We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis. High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number of included studies reduced our confidence in the findings. Thus results must be interpreted with caution. We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP after three to 18 months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section. There is low-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery. There is moderate evidence that intravenous infusion of local anaesthetics may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery.Our conclusions are considerably weakened by the small size and number of studies, by performance bias, null bias, attrition and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies, including children, are needed. We caution that except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies. On a cautionary note, we cannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions or regional anaesthesia techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral block reduces the risk of PPP after thoracotomy. There are seven ongoing studies and 12 studies awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the current review once they are published and incorporated.",breast_neoplasms

Retrospective study of 14 patients who underwent postoperative 3DCRT for left breast cancer in 2014. All data were retrieved from medical records. Means, medians, ranges, and percentages were calculated. max values in the sample were 9.71?Gy and 33.2?Gy, respectively. The maximum dose to the LAD (D2%) ranged from 3.66 to 53.01?Gy. Due to the spacing of the CT slices (5?mm), it was not possible to completely contour the entire artery. The mean dose to the heart (3.3?Gy) was considered acceptable. The maximum dose to the LAD was as high as 53?Gy, suggesting an increased risk of cardiac morbidity. This study underscores the value of contouring the LAD and the value of the breath hold technique to reduce maximum cardiac doses. Smaller CT cuts (2.5?mm) can improve contouring.

Screening outcome was determined for recalled women with or without evaluation of contralateral breast abnormalities. Of 3,995 recalls (recall rate 3.1%), 129 women (3.2%) underwent assessment of a contralateral, non-recalled breast abnormality. Most lesions were detected at clinical mammography and/or breast tomosynthesis (101 women, 78.3%). The biopsy rate was similar for recalled lesions and contralateral, non-recalled lesions, but the positive predictive value of biopsy was higher for recalled lesions (p = 0.01). A comparable proportion of the recalled lesions and contralateral, non-recalled lesions were malignant (p = 0.1). The proportion of ductal carcinoma in situ was similar for both groups, as well as invasive cancer characteristics and type of surgical treatment. About 3% of recalled women underwent evaluation of contralateral, non-recalled breast lesions.

Married females were selected, with children and short breast feeding period. Cancer stage I-III was considered for the study and patients were grouped on the basis of Tumor grade, Tumor size, lymph node metastasis and disease free survival. Disease staging was based on tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Biochemical estimations included variations in random blood glucose level and lipid profile. Lipid profile and random blood glucose level were found significantly high (p<0.05) compared to control subjects. Hyperlipidemia was significantly high in breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis. On increase in tumor grade I to II, increase in total cholesterol (4%), LDL-cholesterol 23% and 11% increase in triglycerides was observed. On Tumor size increase from ??2 to 2.5cm, increase observed in blood random glucose level was (4%), total cholesterol (1.7%) triglycerides (2%) and LDL (3%) whereas HDL was (2%) low.

Our prospective cohort comprised 2012 women with breast cancer who reported their weight in each decade from 20 to 50-64?years of age. We used trajectory analysis to identify groups with similar development patterns in BMI and Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between trajectory groups and mortality, and interactions with oestrogen receptor status and smoking. We used c-index statistics to compare the trajectory model with the single measure model of BMI. We identified three distinct trajectory groups, with a mean BMI at age 20 of 19, 22 and 24 increasing to 23 (normal-to-normal), 29 (normal-to-overweight) and 37 (normal-to-obese) at 50-64?years of age, respectively. Women in the normal-to-obese trajectory group experienced significantly higher overall mortality than those in the normal-to-normal trajectory group (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.21?2.56). The association declined to a non-significant level after adjustments for clinical prognostic factors. Although not significant, the same tendency was seen for breast cancer-specific mortality. The association was strongest in women with oestrogen receptor-negative tumours.

Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with recurrence rate as the primary outcome. Out of 7,713 retrieved articles, six studies were included.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2006 and 2010. (i) To determine whether risk-reducing mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of risk-reducing mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. For this Review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 9 July 2016. We included studies in English. Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. At least two review authors independently abstracted data from each report. We summarized data descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. We analyzed data separately for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM). Four review authors assessed the methodological quality to determine whether or not the methods used sufficiently minimized selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias. All 61 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer, who underwent RRM.Twenty-one BRRM studies looking at the incidence of breast cancer or disease-specific mortality, or both, reported reductions after BRRM, particularly for those women with BRCA1/2 mutations. Twenty-six CRRM studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Seven studies attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and showed no overall survival advantage for CRRM. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CRRM, but after adjusting for bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO), the CRRM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Twenty studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have RRM but greater variation in satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BRRM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BRRM, but there was diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings.Seventeen case series reporting on adverse events from RRM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated reoperations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 64% in participants with reconstruction.In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM. While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, BRCA1/2 carriers. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM. Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery.

The regimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction (group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic body irradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P<0.001), pain score and analgesic (P<0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) and practitioner experience (P<0.001) were factors influencing the choice of the regimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapy centre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total of three cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation, respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with a delay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. The re-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate of death was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001) and overall survival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001). This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to the population of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of the treatment regimen were identified.

29599351,"Chemotherapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and docetaxel (TPD regimen) is now strongly recommended as a treatment option for first-line therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-positive breast cancer. In this study, we analyzed the expression of HER 1-4 proteins, and investigated whether or not their expression was predictive of the response of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer to chemotherapy with the TPD regimen. The study consisted of 29 cases in which TPD regimen chemotherapy was carried out from September 2013 to November 2015. The expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67, HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 were evaluated using immunostaining employing needle biopsy specimens. The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the HER3-positive group than in the HER3-negative group (p=0.002). In prognostic analysis, the HER3-positive group showed a significant progression-free survival extension over the HER3-negative group (p=0.042, log-rank). In univariate analysis, objective response (p=0.004, hazard ratio(HR)=0.123) and positive HER3 expression (p=0.023, HR=0.279) significantly contributed to extension of progression-free survival interval.

The serum levels of MMP8 was reported to be higher in patients with breast cancer than in healthy individuals. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of a polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP8 (-799C/T) and two nonsynonymous polymorphisms (Val436Ala and Lys460Thr) to breast cancer. MMP8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr polymorphic genotypes were determined for 1,232 patients with breast cancer and 1,232 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. The odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and alcohol drinking status for those carrying CT and TT genotypes at the MMP8 promoter C-799T were 1.03 (95% CI=0.88-1.23, p=0.7475) and 1.08 (95% CI=0.91-1.53, p=0.3561), respectively, compared to those carrying the wild-type CC genotype. The OR for the combined T-bearing genotypes were of a similar non-significant level (OR=1.05, 95% CI=0.90-1.26, p=0.5176). Supporting this finding, the adjusted OR for those carrying the T allele at MMP8 C-799T was 1.05 (95% CI=0.86-1.21, p=0.3797), compared to those carrying the wild-type C allele. There was also no significant association of MMP8 Lys460Thr with breast cancer. There was no polymorphic genotype at MMP8 Val436Ala found among any of the investigated individuals. MMP8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr polymorphisms may only play an indirect role in determining personal cancer susceptibility to breast cancer in Taiwan.",breast_neoplasms

This study aimed to assess the clinicopathological factors that predict non-SLN metastasis to define subgroups of SLN-positive patients in whom the axilla may be staged by SLN biopsy alone, while avoiding unnecessary overtreatment. The records of 191 patients with histologically-proven primary BC who underwent a positive (SLN) biopsy between 2005 and 2017 were reviewed. Patients with at least one tumor-involved SLN who underwent completion ALND were enrolled. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics, including age, primary tumor size and histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, ratio of positive SLNs to the harvested SLNs, SLN metastasis size, and molecular subtype classification according to immunohistochemical biomarker status [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)], were evaluated. Data were collected retrospectively and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests (statistical significance: p<0.05). - profile (OR=2.95, p=0.027). There was a tendency (statistically insignificant; p>0.05) toward higher incidence of non SLN metastasis with increasing age and histological grade, which could be attributed to the small sample size. According to this study, sentinel nodal ratio and BC subtypes as per ER, PR, and HER2 status significantly predicted the likelihood of additional lymphatic involvement.

The purpose of this study is to clarify whether miR-96 is similarly associated with tumor invasion in colorectal cancer. We performed western blotting to investigate the expression of RECK when miR-96 mimics or inhibitors were transferred into HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells. The RECK mRNA level was assessed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An invasion assay was used to evaluate tumor invasion. The expression of RECK was inhibited by the transfection of miR-96 mimics. RECK mRNA level was reduced by miR-96 mimics and increased by miR-96 inhibitor. In the invasion assay, miR-96 mimics were shown to promote tumor invasion. miR-96 may be associated with tumor invasion through inhibition of RECK expression in colorectal cancer.",breast_neoplasms

We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman with previous chest radiotherapy for breast cancer who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery for severe bilateral coronary ostial lesions. Coronary angiography demonstrated severe, isolated bilateral coronary ostial lesions. The patient underwent urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery to treat her critical coronary artery disease. Intra-operatively, internal mammary arteries were not amenable to harvesting due to very dense mediastinal adhesions. Therefore, saphenous vein grafts were performed to the left anterior descending, distal left circumflex, obtuse marginal and distal right coronary arteries. The patient made a satisfactory in-hospital recovery, and was subsequently discharged back to her local hospital for rehabilitation. Patients successfully treated with mediastinal radiotherapy require careful long-term follow-up for the assessment of radiation-induced coronary artery disease. Importantly, mediastinal irradiation may preclude internal mammary artery utilization, and thus alter the strategy for surgical myocardial revascularization.",breast_neoplasms

However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and survival outcome. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics, relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127 patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between cfDNA and OS (HR?=?2.41, 95% CI, 1.83-3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR?=?2.73, 95% CI, 2.04-3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83-3.51), which is close to the original HR. Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source, detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area.

Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast was found in 7 out of 1,164 patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the period of 12 years in our hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were retrieved from the patient files, and their final status was verified by a phone call. Diagnoses of the patients were confirmed by examining hematohylen and eosin (H&E) preparations. They were stained immunohistochemically for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), C-erbB-2, CK5/6 (Sitokeratin5/6), and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), and the subgroups were determined according to the WHO classification. All patients were female with a median age of 61 years (41-87 years). Three of them were diagnosed with stage IIB, 2 with IIIB and 1 with IV. Four patients had squamous type of metaplastic cell differentiation, 1 spindle, 1 adenosquamous, and 1 osteosarcomatous. In 6 out of 7 patients, ER, PR and C-erbB-2 expressions were negative immunohistochemically. In the case of squamous metaplasia, estrogen receptor was 10% and progesterone receptor was 5% positive. CK5/6 was positive in 5 cases. Epidermal growth factor was positive in all cases. Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is relatively rare and, in our series, its incidence was 0.6%. According to its immunohistochemical characteristics, MpBC can be interpreted as a subgroup of triplenegative breast cancers (TNBC). Five of the presented patients resembled the subgroup of TNBC with a basaloid phenotype.

We aimed to create a Chinese version of EPIC to further research in the Chinese-speaking population. A prototype was created by forward-backward translations and revisions. During cultural adaptation, 15 participants were interviewed after they had completed the prototype. A few issues highlighted included confusion related to the question format, subject non-familiarity with the Chinese term for ""hot flashes,"" and the use of the Chinese term for ""breast"" as a strictly female body part. A pilot version was created based on the cultural adaptation findings. Validation of the pilot version was performed by having 50 participants complete the Chinese EPIC and EORTC QLQ-c30 twice within a 4-week period.

29506331,"A persistent problem in autologous breast reconstruction in skin-sparing mastectomies is skin restoration after skin necrosis or secondary oncological resection. As a solution to facilitate reconstruction, skin banking of free-flap skin has been proposed in cases where the overlying skin envelope must be resected, as this technique spares the patient an additional donor site. Herein, we present the largest series to date in which this method was used. We investigated its safety and the possibility of skin banking for prolonged periods of time. All skin-sparing mastectomies and immediate autologous breast reconstructions from December 2009 until June 2013 at our institution were analysed. We identified 31 patients who underwent 33 free flap reconstructions in which skin banking was performed. Our median skin banking period was 7 days, with a maximum duration of 171 days. In 22.5% of cases, the banked skin was used to reconstruct overlying skin defects, and in 9.6% of cases to reconstruct the nipple-areolar complex. Microbiological and histological investigations of the banked skin revealed neither clinical infections nor malignancies. In situ skin banking, even for prolonged periods of time, is a safe and cost-effective method to ensure that skin defects due to necrosis or secondary oncological resection can be easily reconstructed.",breast_neoplasms

AgNPs have been used in vitro for treatment of various diseases, such as hepatitis B and herpes simplex infections as well as colon, cervical, and lung cancers. In this study, we assessed the effect on proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines of different molecular profiles (MCF7, HCC1954, and HCC70) exposed to AgNPs (2-9 nm). Breast cancer cell lines were incubated in vitro; MTT assay was used to assess proliferation. Adhesion was determined by real-time analysis with the xCELLingence system. Propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V assay were used to measure apoptosis. The transcriptome was assessed by gene expression microarray and Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) analyses. p??0.05). We observed a significant reduction in the proliferation of MCF7 and HCC70, but not in HCC1954. Apoptotic activity was seen in all cell lines exposed to AgNPs, with an apoptosis percentage of more than 60% in cancer cell lines and less than 60% in the control. PGM analysis confirmed, to some extent, the effects of AgNPs primarily on adhesion by changes in the extracellular matrix.

While the hamartomas are benign, patients with CS have increased risk of osteosarcoma and of breast, thyroid, endometrial, soft-tissue and colonic neoplasms. Germline mutations of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are implicated in CS and in the development of osteosarcoma. We report a patient with CS who presented with osteosarcoma, ganglioneuromatosis and a benign breast mass. Osteosarcoma, as presentation of CS, is rare (only one report in the English literature). Genomic DNA from the patient's peripheral blood was quantified by spectrophotometry, then underwent sequence enrichment, polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing. Molecular analysis revealed a non-synonymous c.17_18delAA frameshift mutation in exon 1 of PTEN and a c.116G>T (p.R39L) missense mutation of serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) of unknown significance.

29496164,"Despite advancements in the prognosis and management of breast cancer, it remains a major cause of mortality in women worldwide. Centchroman (CC), an oral contraceptive has been found to exhibit anti-cancer potential against a wide range of cancer including breast cancer. The present study is intended to evaluate the ability of soy isoflavone Daidzein (DZ) in enhancing the efficacy of CC in Human Breast Cancer Cells (HBCCs). Sulforhodamine B assay was employed to determine the cytotoxicity induced by 10??M CC & 50??M DZ separately and together in MCF-7/MDA MB-231 HBCCs and non-tumorigenic Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HMECs) MCF-10A as a control. Combination Index (CI) analysis was executed using CompuSyn software. Further, apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V/PI, AO/PI staining and tunel assay. Cell cycle, reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration was determined using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to check the expression of respective proteins. The results suggest that the combination exerts elevated toxicity as compared to control and each drug per se without affecting HMECs MCF-10A. This therefore implies cancer cell specific action of CC plus DZ administered together. Additionally, combination index analysis suggests synergistic action of CC and DZ combination in HBCCs. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V/PI staining, tunel assay and western blot analysis confirms the induction of apoptosis by combination in HBCCs. Interestingly, western blot analysis also revealed that the combination down-regulated the expression of proteins involved in cell survival i.e. PI3K, Akt and mTOR, suggesting inhibition of cell survival pathway. The results overall demonstrate that CC plus DZ has higher anticancer efficacy as compared to either drug alone. Hence, the combination of CC plus DZ may offer a novel strategy for the management of breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29495003,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and BMP receptors widely participate in osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer, while their role in tumor-stromal interaction is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether BMP receptor type 1a (BMPR1a) can alter the interaction between metastatic cancer cells and osteoclast precursors. Adenovirus-mediated RNA interference was used to interrupt target genes of human breast cancer cell lines and nude mice were injected intratibially with the cancer cells. Tumor-bearing mice were examined by bioluminescence imaging and microCT. Sections of metastatic legs were measured by a series of staining methods. Murine bone marrow mononuclear cells or RAW264.7 cells were cultured with conditioned media of breast cancer cells. RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA were used to test mRNA and protein expressions of target molecules. Expression of BMPR1a of MDA-MB-231-luc cells at tumor-bone interface was apparently stronger than that of cancer cells distant from the interface. Mice injected with BMPR1a-knockdown MDA-MB-231-luc cells showed reduced tumor growth and bone destruction compared with control groups. Knockdown (KD) of BMPR1a of MDA-MB-231-luc cells or MCF-7 cells decreased the level of receptor activator for NF-??B ligand (RANKL). Level of RANKL in MDA-MB-231-luc cells or MCF-7 cells was reduced by p38 inhibitor. Compared with control group, knockdown of p38 of breast cancer cells decreased cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis. Knockdown of BMPR1a of breast cancer cells suppresses their production of RANKL via p38 pathway and inhibits cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis, which indicates that BMPR1a might be a possible target in breast cancer-induced osteolytic metastasis.",breast_neoplasms

The aim of the work was to overcome the current limitations in the clinical use of therapeutic antibodies, including immunogenicity, poor pharmacokinetics, low tumor penetration and safety issues. Trastuzumab-loaded PLGA NPs (PLGA-TZ) were synthesized according to a double emulsion method. The same protocol was used to produce control batches of nonspecific IgG-loaded NPs and empty PLGA NPs. After release of TZ from PLGA NPs, the effects on the main biological activities of the antibody were evaluated on SKBR3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-positive breast cancer cell line), including specific binding to HER2, phosphorylation of HER2 (Y1248), degradation of HER2 protein and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. In addition, an MTT assay was performed for treating SKBR3 cells with PLGA NPs loaded with TZ and doxorubicin to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the combined treatment. TZ was gradually released in a prolonged way over 30 days. The physical characterization performed with circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy of TZ after release demonstrated that no structural alterations occurred compared to the native antibody. In vitro experiments using SKBR3 cells showed that TZ released from PLGA NPs maintained the same biological activity of native TZ. PLGA NPs allowed a good co-encapsulation efficiency of TZ and doxorubicin resulting in improved therapy. With the TZ case study, we demonstrate that the distinctive features of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, including molecular targeting efficiency, capability to inhibit or properly affect the regulatory signaling pathways of cancer cells and stimulation of the ADCC, are fully preserved after loading into and release from PLGA NPs. In addition, PLGA NPs are shown to allow for the simultaneous incorporation of TZ and conventional chemotherapeutics, resulting in a potent antitumor nanodrug well suited for in situ combination and neoadjuvant therapy.",breast_neoplasms

Women 45-65 years of age were interviewed by questionnaire containing 15 structured questions focused on socioeconomic status and barriers to screening. A total of 3,313 women completed the questionnaire. The main reasons for avoiding screening were work absenteeism (18.9%), fear of painful examination (18.39%), and poor understanding of mammography screening (14.94%). Education is required to increase awareness among women about the utility and availability of breast screening services.

29491093,"Radiation dermatitis is observed in 95% of breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between protein expression in tumor cells and the risk of developing radiation dermatitis. Breast cancer patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy were included in this study. Tumor specimens from 122 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Ki67, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1a), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and a-glucosidase (aGluc). The findings were correlated with the occurrence and severity of radiation dermatitis (Radiation therapy oncology group-RTOG grading scale), taking into consideration body weight and skin type (Fitzpatrick system). Data were explored further via pathway and network analyses. Correlation of radiation dermatitis (RTOG scale) with the observed increased expression of Ki67, ATM, iNOS, HIF-1a and aGluc, failed to reach statistical significance when skin type and/or body weight were considered. Network interactions of proteins involved in tumor growth (Ki67, ATM) and/or affect the oxidation state of the cell (HIF-1a, iNOS, aGluc) were revealed, that may contribute to the risk of developing acute radiation dermatitis. Correlation of the increased expression of the studied proteins and the occurrence and severity of radiation dermatitis in women undergoing postoperative radiotherapy, failed to reach statistical significance. Pathway and network analyses predicted that vasodilation and angiogenesis may contribute to radiation-induced dermatitis via mechanisms that need to be further explored. Our strategy serves as a paradigm for coupling histopathological data to molecular findings and network analyses for risk assessment in the clinic.",breast_neoplasms

Nineteen patients received fulvestrant, 10 of whom had visceral metastasis. The median time to progression was 4 months for the overall study population; it was significantly longer for patients with non-visceral metastasis (5.4 months; 95% confidence interval=3.7-11.2 months) than for those with visceral metastasis (3.3 months; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-5.3 months; p=0.01).

29491076,"The prognostic and predictive role of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2) in breast cancer is still debated, and in particular, its role as a target of COX2 inhibitor (celecoxib) in neoadjuvant setting. We analyzed a series of 156 breast cancer samples from patients of the COX2 inhibitor-treated arm included in the REMAGUS-02 randomized phase II trial. COX2 gene expression was assessed by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using ribonucleic acid from frozen biopsies. Pathological complete response (pCR) was the surrogate end-point. Significantly higher rates of grade 3, and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity were observed in tumors with the highest expression of COX2. pCR rates were significantly higher in COX2-overexpressing tumors in patients receiving celecoxib. The test for interaction between COX2 gene expression and the celecoxib effect was statistically significant (p<0.01), but was not retained in the multivariate analysis. COX2 overexpression is predictive of pCR in patients with celecoxib-treated tumors. The efficacy of celecoxib in breast cancer might be improved by quantification of COX2 gene expression.",breast_neoplasms

The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) prevents endometrial cancer, and recent studies suggested that it may also prevent ovarian cancer, but with a concurrent increased risk of breast cancer. We compared adjusted risks of ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer in ever users and never users of LNG-IUS. Our study cohort consisted of 104,318 women from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, 9144 of whom were ever users and 95,174 of whom were never users of LNG-IUS. Exposure information was taken from self-administered questionnaires, and cancer cases were identified through linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Poisson regression using robust error estimates. Median age at inclusion was 52years and mean follow-up time was 12.5 (standard deviation 3.7) years, for a total of 1,305,435 person-years. Among ever users of LNG-IUS there were 18 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer, 15 cases of endometrial cancer, and 297 cases of breast cancer. When ever users were compared to never users of LNG-IUS, the multivariable RR of ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.88), 0.22 (0.13, 0.40), and 1.03 (0.91, 1.17), respectively.

We investigated 120 women with primary breast cancer and median follow-up of 138 months. Serum levels of TS and SHBG and patient's BMI were evaluated before surgery. The contribution of TS, SHBG, their ratio (TS/SHBG) and BMI to the predictive capability of tumor-specific biomarkers was investigated by Harrell's c statistic. TS alone did not affect prognosis, whereas SHBG was protective in postmenopausal patients, in which BMI was associated with a progressive increase in the relapse-specific hazard ratio (HR). When in combination, TS, SHBG and BMI, affected prognosis in different ways depending on menopausal status. The best predictive capability (c = 0.78) was observed in postmenopausal patients when at the basic model (N + TLI) were added TS, BMI, TS * BMI interaction, with or without SHBG. In premenopause subgroup, the best predictive capability (c = 0.67) was provided by the basic model (N + TLI) plus TS and SHBG or their ratio, BMI and TS * BMI or TS/SHBG * BMI interaction. Patient-associated features such as BMI and serum levels of TS and SHBG can improve the predictive capability of consolidate tumor-specific biomarkers in both pre- and postmenopause, thus providing a relevant contribution to the decision-making process.",breast_neoplasms

Four radiologists evaluated the clinical image quality of 374 invasive screen-detected cancers and 356 invasive interval breast cancers for which quality evaluation of screening mammograms could be assessed from cancers diagnosed among participants in the Quebec Breast Cancer Screening Program in 2007. Quality evaluation was based on the Canadian Association of Radiologists accreditation criteria, which are similar to those of the American College of Radiology. The association between clinical quality and screening sensitivity was assessed by logistic regression. Adjusted sensitivity and adjusted sensitivity ratios were obtained through marginal standardization. No institutional review board approval was required. A proportion of 28% (206 of 730) of screening mammograms had lower overall quality for the majority of assessments. Positioning was the quality attribute that was the most frequently deficient. The 2-year screening sensitivity reached 68%. Sensitivity of screening was not statistically associated with the overall quality (ratio of 2-year sensitivity?=?1.03; 95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.15) or with any quality attributes (positioning, exposure, compression, sharpness, artifacts, contrast). Results were similar for the 1-year sensitivity. Although not all mammograms in the Quebec screening program met the optimum quality required by the Canadian Association of Radiologists or American College of Radiology accreditation, the screening mammograms produced in this population-based organized screening program reached a high enough level of quality so that the remaining variation in quality is too little to impair screening sensitivity.",breast_neoplasms

The medullary phenotype and triple negative intrinsic subtypes are often, but not exclusively encountered in BRCA1 germline mutated breast cancer, whilst for BRCA2, no association to specific histological features are known. In this study, we addressed the relationship between morphological medullary phenotype and BRCA1/2 somatic mutations in breast cancer without known positive family anamnesis. 32 clinically sporadic breast cancers with medullary features were analyzed for somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (all coding exons) with next-generation sequencing technology. Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed breast cancer samples from all patients were analyzed. Three of 32 tumors (9%) had pathogenic (ARUP class-5) BRCA1 gene alterations. Two of these pathogenic variants exhibited deletions leading to frameshift mutations (p.Glu23fs, p.Val1234fs), and the remaining single-nucleotid-variant resulted in premature STOP codon (p.Glu60Ter). In one patient, the same pathogenic BRCA1 mutation was detected (p.Glu23fs) in normal breast tissue. Retrospective follow-up in two patients revealed a positive family history for breast cancer and consecutive germline mutation testing confirmed presence of BRCA1 mutations. No somatic pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were detected. BRCA1 mutation testing may be useful in clinically sporadic breast cancer patients with medullary features to identify potential mutation carriers independently from intrinsic molecular subtype.

Exclusion criteria were the presence of personal history of breast cancer or other high-risk lesions; association with other synchronous lesions, both more and less advanced proliferative lesions. The 65 included patients were all females, with age range of 40-79 years (mean 54 years). The maximum diameter range of the groups of microcalcifications was 4-11 mm (mean 6.2 mm), all classified as BI-RADS 4b (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4b) and defined as fine pleomorphic in 29 cases (45%) or amorphous in 36 cases (55%). The range of follow-up length was 12-156 months (mean 67 months). Only one patients developed new microcalcifications, in the same breast, 48 months after and 15 mm from the first VAB, interpreted as low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at surgical excision.

However, the potential of citral to specifically target the drug resistant breast cancer cells has not yet been tested, which was the focus of our current study. The cytotoxic activity of citral was first tested on MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro by MTT assay. Subsequently, spheroids of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were developed and treated with citral at different concentrations. Doxorubicin, cisplatin and tamoxifen were used as positive controls to evaluate the drug resistance phenotype of MDA-MB-231 spheroids. In addition, apoptosis study was performed using AnnexinV/7AAD flowcytometry.

Moreover, the AnnexinV/7AAD results demonstrated that citral induced both early and late apoptotic changes in a dose-dependent manner compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, citral treated spheroids showed lower cell renewal capacity compared to the vehicle control spheroids in the mammosphere formation assay. Gene expression studies using quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting assays showed that citral was able to suppress the self-renewal capacity of spheroids and downregulate the Wnt/??-catenin pathway. The results suggest that citral could be a potential new agent which can eliminate drug-resistant breast cancer cells in a spheroid model via inducing apoptosis.",breast_neoplasms
29429017,"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has the potential to overcome limitations of conventional mammography. This study investigated the effects of addition of DBT on interval and detected cancers in population-based screening. Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (OTST) was a prospective, independent double-reading trial inviting women 50-69?years biennially, comparing full-field digital mammography (FFDM) plus DBT with FFDM alone. Performance indicators and characteristics of screen-detected and interval cancers were compared with two previous FFDM rounds. 24,301 consenting women underwent FFDM?+?DBT screening over a 2-year period. Results were compared with 59,877 FFDM examinations during prior rounds. Addition of DBT resulted in a non-significant increase in sensitivity (76.2%, 378/496, vs. 80.8%, 227/281, p?=?0.151) and a significant increase in specificity (96.4%, 57229/59381 vs. 97.5%, 23427/24020, p?<?.001). Number of recalls per screen-detected cancer decreased from 6.7 (2530/378) to 3.6 (820/227) with DBT (p?<?.001). Cancer detection per 1000 women screened increased (6.3, 378/59877, vs. 9.3, 227/24301, p?<?.001). Interval cancer rate per 1000 screens for FFDM?+?DBT remained similar to previous FFDM rounds (2.1, 51/24301 vs. 2.0, 118/59877, p?=?0.734). Interval cancers post-DBT were comparable to prior rounds but significantly different in size, grade, and node status from cancers detected only using DBT. 39.6% (19/48) of interval cancers had positive nodes compared with only 3.9% (2/51) of additional DBT-only-detected cancers. DBT-supplemented screening resulted in significant increases in screen-detected cancers and specificity. However, no significant change was observed in the rate, size, node status, or grade of interval cancers. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01248546.",breast_neoplasms
29427661,"Increasing evidence has emphasized the important roles of differentially expressed miRNAs in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) development. miR-199a-5p was previously documented to be downregulated in PTCs compared with normal thyroids. However, the role of miR-199a-5p in the progression of PTC and the underlying mechanism remain to be further addressed. miR-199a-5p and snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAI1) mRNA expressions in PTC tissues and cells were detected by qRT-PCR. The effects of miR-199a-5p and SNAI1 on cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays, and western blot, respectively. The relationship between miR-199a-5p and SNAI1 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Xenograft tumor assay was performed to verify the role of miR-199a-5p and molecular mechanism in PTC. miR-199a-5p expression was significantly downregulated and SNAI1 was markedly upregulated in PTC tissues and cells. miR-199a-5p overexpression and SNAI1 knockdown suppressed the progression of PTC cells in?vitro, as evidenced by the reduced cell migration, invasion and EMT. Of note, SNAI1 was identified as a target of miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-5p suppressed SNAI1 expression in PTC cells. Xenograft tumor assay proved that miR-199a-5p overexpression suppressed tumor growth in PTC in?vivo by downregulating SNAI1. miR-199a-5p inhibited the progression of PTC by downregulating SNAI1, offering new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying PTC progression.",breast_neoplasms

The aim of this meta-analysis was to provide a pooled analysis of comparative clinical studies that evaluated breast cancer patients who were treated with a mastectomy and an immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction to compare the complications and satisfaction of those who underwent or did not undergo PMRT. According to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration, we established a rigorous study protocol. We performed a systematic electronic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to identify articles for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Reconstruction failure, overall complications, capsular contracture, and patient satisfaction were analyzed individually. Fifteen controlled trials were included, comprising 5314 patients (1069 PMRT vs 4245 non-PMRT). Primary outcomes revealed a statistically significant increase in overall complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.45; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.62-4.54; P?<?.00001], reconstruction failure (OR: 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.62; P?=?.001), and capsular contracture (OR: 5.26, 95% CI: 2.73-10.13, P?<?.00001) after receiving PMRT. Our review found that PMRT for patients who underwent immediate implant-based breast reconstruction led to higher risks of reconstruction failure, overall complications, and capsular contracture. However, it is still the standard adjuvant therapy for mastectomy patients who have opted for immediate implant-based breast reconstruction.",breast_neoplasms
29415049,"Recent studies demonstrate that interstitial inorganic phosphate is significantly elevated in the breast cancer microenvironment as compared to normal tissue. In addition it has been shown that breast cancer cells express high levels of the NaPi-IIb carrier (SLC34A2), suggesting that this carrier may play a role in breast cancer progression. However, the biochemical behavior of inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in this cancer type remains elusive. In this work, we characterize the kinetic parameters of Pi transport in the aggressive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and correlated Pi transport with cell migration and adhesion. We determined the influence of sodium concentration, pH, metabolic inhibitors, as well as the affinity for inorganic phosphate in Pi transport. We observed that the inorganic phosphate is dependent on sodium transport (K0,5 value = 21.98 mM for NaCl). Furthermore, the transport is modulated by different pH values and increasing concentrations of Pi, following the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K0,5 = 0.08 mM Pi). PFA, monensin, furosemide and ouabain inhibited Pi transport, cell migration and adhesion. Taken together, these results showed that the uptake of Pi in MDA-MB-231 cells is modulated by sodium and by regulatory mechanisms of intracellular sodium gradient. General Significance: Pi transport might be regarded as a potential target for therapy against tumor progression.",breast_neoplasms

Breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, SKB-R3, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435) and a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) were prepared for this study. MiR-223 mimics, anti-miR-223 and pcDNA 3.1-STIM1 were transiently transfected into cancer cells independently or together, and then RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expressions of miR-223 and STIM1 mRNA, dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to examine the effects of miR-223 on STIM1, Western blotting was used to measure the expressions of the STIM1 proteins, MTT and Trans-well assays were performed to detect cell proliferation and invasion. Finally, the correlation of miR-223 and STIM1 was investigated by detecting with ISH and IHC in breast cancer specimens or the corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Compared with normal cells and tissues, breast cancer tissues and cells exhibited significantly lower expression of miR-223, but higher expression of STIM1. MiR-223 could inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells by negatively regulating the expressions of STIM1. Reimplantation with STIM1 partially rescued the miRNA-223-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells. Clinical data revealed that high expression of STIM1 and miR-223 was respectively detrimental and beneficial factor impacting patient's disease-free survival (DFS) rather than overall survival (OS). Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis also confirmed that STIM1 was inversely correlated with miR-223. MiR-223 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer by targeting STIM1. The miR-223/STIM1 axis could possibly be a potential therapeutic target for treating breast cancer patients.",breast_neoplasms

Double-blinded (patient and assessor) randomized controlled trial. A university hospital. Breast cancer patients (N=50) with pain. The intervention group received a single BTX-A infiltration. The control group received a placebo (saline) infiltration. Within 1 week after the infiltration, all patients attended an individual physical therapy program (12 sessions) during the first 3 months and a home exercise program up to 6 months after infiltration. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity at the upper limb (visual analog scale, 0-100) after 3 months. Secondary outcomes were prevalence rate of pain, pressure hypersensitivity, pain quality, shoulder function, and quality of life. Measures were taken before the intervention and at 1, 3, and 6 months' follow-up. No significant difference in change in pain intensity after 3 months was found (mean difference in change, 3/100; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13 to 19). From baseline up to 6 months, a significantly different change in upper limb pain intensity was found between groups in favor of the intervention group (mean difference in change, 16/100; 95% CI, 1-31). A single BTX-A infiltration in combination with an individual physical therapy program significantly decreased pain intensity at the upper limb in breast cancer survivors up to 6 months.

We performed this meta-analysis to assess the clinical effect of using PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors on advanced solid tumours. All the randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared the therapy with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors with other therapies were included. The main end-point was progression-free survival (PFS); other end-points included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). A subgroup analysis was performed mainly for PFS. In total, 46 eligible RCT were included. The pooled results showed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor-based regimens significantly improved the PFS of patients with advanced solid tumours (hazard ratios (HR) = 0.79; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.71-0.88) and PI3K pathway mutations (HR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56-0.85). All single PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor therapies were compared with other targeted therapies (HR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.93-1.06) and dual targeted therapies, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors and other targeted therapies (HR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.62-1.74), which showed no significant differences in the PFS. Additional PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors showed no advantage with respect to the OS (HR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.90-1.07) or ORR (risk ratio (RR) = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.87-1.20). Our meta-analysis results suggest that the addition of the PI3K pathway inhibitors to the therapy regiment for advanced solid tumours significantly improves PFS. The way that patients are selected to receive the PI3K pathway inhibitors might be more meaningful in the future.",breast_neoplasms

The purpose of this research is to explore how oncologists vary in their usage and definition of the word cure when talking to patients. Qualitative and exploratory pilot study conducted by semi structured interviews with a group of French oncologists about a clinical vignette of localized breast cancer treated by surgery and complete adjuvant treatment. Thirteen oncologists participated in this study between January and March 2016. They were divided into two groups according to whether or not they use the term cure in their clinical practice. A first group of five doctors define the word cure as the lasting absence of relapse of the disease. Because of their duty of transparency and the uncertainty of post-therapeutic relapse, these five doctors tend to never use the word cure. The analysis of the second group of eight doctors, who do use of the word cure in their practice, highlighted an absence of consensus on its definition. However, all of them justify their use of it with the importance of expressing positive emotions such as hope to patients. Our findings confirm that there are divergent understandings of the concept of cure between oncologists and how they manage prognosis uncertainty. Medical language is thus influenced by scientific knowledge, but also by doctors' personal values and ways of thinking, perhaps influencing the doctor-patient relationship in turn. This exploratory study will be extended on a wider scale to explore the coexistence of other elements of diversity.",breast_neoplasms

The tumor elasticity was measured by SE or RT-SWE before and after therapy. Tumor cell density was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the ratio of collagen fibers in the tumor was evaluated by Van Gieson staining. The correlation between tumor elasticity, as determined by SE and SWE, as well as the pathological tumor responses were analyzed. Chemotherapy signi?cantly attenuated tumor growth compared to the control treatment (p < 0.05). Chemotherapy also significantly increased tumor stiffness (p < 0.05) and signi?cantly decreased (p < 0.05) tumor cell density compared with the control. Moreover, chemotherapy significantly increased the ratio of collagen fibers (p < 0.05). Tumor stiffness was positively correlated with the ratio of collagen fibers but negatively correlated with tumor cell density. The study suggests that ultrasound elastography by SE and SWE is a feasible tool for assessing early responses of breast cancer to chemotherapy in our murine xenograft model. Advances in knowledge: This study showed that the tumor elasticity determined by ultrasound elastography could be a feasible imaging biomarker for assessing very early therapeutic responses to chemotherapy.",breast_neoplasms

We studied patient and provider factors associated with clinical stage at diagnosis among women diagnosed at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg in 2015-2016. From face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires we compared self-reported socioeconomics, demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, personal and health system barriers, and from patient clinical records, clinical staging, receptor subtype, and tumor grade among 499 consecutive women newly diagnosed with advanced stage (III/IV) breast cancer versus those diagnosed early (stage 0/I/II). Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis. Among the women, 243 (49%) were diagnosed at early and 256 (51%) at advanced stages. In the multiple logistic regression adjusted model, completion of high school or beyond (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, and greater breast cancer knowledge and awareness (OR 0.86) were associated with lower stage of breast cancer at presentation.

Four cases of MEC of the breast are reported in this study. All patients were women with ages ranging from 39 to 66 years. The lesions consisted of neoplastic solid nests and cystic spaces sometimes filled with mucoid material. At high power, the tumors were composed of various proportions of basaloid, intermediate, epidermoid, and mucinous cells in different cases. All cases were classified as low-grade MEC of the breast. Tumor cells exhibited low levels of hormonal receptor expression in two cases (cases 1 and 3), and immunonegativity in one case (case 2). On the contrary, estrogen receptors (ER) were positively expressed in 60% of tumor cells in case 4. Tumor cells did not express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu protein in all the cases. Modified radical mastectomy (Auchincloss) was performed in the first two cases, while the remaining two patients underwent mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. All patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrent disease after a period ranging from 4 months to 156 months. MEC of the breast is a rare primary carcinoma that is difficult to diagnose.

No serious adverse events, for example hospitalisation or deaths, were reported in included trials. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions were associated with a higher risk of musculoskeletal symptoms (RR 19.03, 95% CI 1.17, 310.52, P = 0.04, two RCTs, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence to determine the effect of combined lifestyle and behavioural interventions on survival, quality of life, or significant weight loss in women with a history of endometrial cancer compared to those receiving usual care. The limited evidence suggests that there is little or no serious or life-threatening adverse effects due to these interventions, although musculoskeletal problems were increased, presumably due to increased activity levels. Our conclusion is based on low- and very low-quality evidence from a small number of trials and very few patients. We therefore have very little confidence in the evidence: the true effect of weight-loss interventions in obese women with endometrial cancer is currently not known.Further methodologically-rigorous, adequately-powered RCTs are required with follow-up of 5 to 10 years duration.

The prognostic factors were evaluated using uni- and multivariate analyses. The number of ER- and PgR-positive cancers had increased over the years (P < 0.001). Tumor sizes and numbers of involved lymph nodes both gradually decreased (P < 0.001 for both). OS and RFS of all patients significantly improved in each of the periods analyzed: 5-year OS was 92.6%, 94.8%, 95.4% and 97.6% (P < 0.001, Log-rank), and 5-year RFS was 82.1%, 82.8%, 88.6% and 94.5% (P < 0.001) in 1992-96, 1997-2001, 2002-06 and 2007-10, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the history of adjuvant AI and that of TAM had positive-correlation with RFS. The prognosis for HR-positive HER2-negative BC patients after surgical therapy has improved, resulting in longer OS and RFS across the study periods.

Besides, in the present research, its associations with pathological features and prognostic indicators of meningioma were examined. In the present study, 68 meningioma patients along with 20 healthy age-sex matched individuals, as controls, were selected. Levels of HER2 in the sera were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The observations showed that HER2 serum levels in meningioma patients were significantly lower than normal controls. However, outlier quantities were mostly observed in the cases. Furthermore, in meningiomas with higher histological grade (grade II, III), statistically significant elevated serum levels of HER2 were observed compared to patients with low-grade meningiomas (grade I). The results showed that serum HER2 levels were a poor biomarker for determination of pathological and prognostic characteristics of meningiomas and coupling serum HER2 levels with immuno-histo-chemistry (IHC) examination of HER2 in meningioma tissue samples would be helpful in future studies.",breast_neoplasms

To date, there have been only 6 similar cases in the literature, and most patients in these reports had very poor prognosis. We report a 61-year-old female presented pain and numbness on the right side of the face 5 years after being diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tissue mass in the sphenoid sinus. The tissue biopsy confirmed metastasis of breast cancer. The patient received initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy plus 10 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy OUTCOMES:: The patient got long-term progression-free survival time. The total time to progression was 32 months. Although breast cancer rarely metastasizes to the head and neck region, awareness should be raised when breast cancer patients experience headache or have sinus-related symptoms. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be effective to treat paranasal sinus metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer, and patients may achieve long-term survival.",breast_neoplasms
29376559,"Women with a diagnosis of breast cancer may experience short- and long-term disease and treatment-related adverse physiological and psychosocial outcomes. These outcomes can negatively impact prognosis, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychosocial and physical function. Physical activity may help to improve prognosis and may alleviate the adverse effects of adjuvant therapy. To assess effects of physical activity interventions after adjuvant therapy for women with breast cancer. We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group (CBCG) Specialised Registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, on 18 September 2015. We also searched OpenGrey and Healthcare Management Information Consortium databases. We searched for randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing physical activity interventions versus control (e.g. usual or standard care, no physical activity, no exercise, attention control, placebo) after adjuvant therapy (i.e. after completion of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, but not hormone therapy) in women with breast cancer. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to ask for additional information when needed. We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes. We included 63 trials that randomised 5761 women to a physical activity intervention (n = 3239) or to a control (n = 2524). The duration of interventions ranged from 4 to 24 months, with most lasting 8 or 12 weeks (37 studies). Twenty-eight studies included aerobic exercise only, 21 involved aerobic exercise and resistance training, and seven used resistance training only. Thirty studies described the comparison group as usual or standard care, no intervention, or control. One-fifth of studies reported at least 20% intervention attrition and the average physical activity adherence was approximately 77%.No data were available on effects of physical activity on breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality, or on breast cancer recurrence. Analysis of immediately postintervention follow-up values and change from baseline to end of intervention scores revealed that physical activity interventions resulted in significant small-to-moderate improvements in HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57, 22 studies, 1996 women; SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17, 14 studies, 1459 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), emotional function (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, 26 studies, 2102 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.53, 15 studies, 1579 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), perceived physical function (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.49, 25 studies, 2129 women; SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97, 13 studies, 1433 women, respectively; moderate-quality evidence), anxiety (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.19, 7 studies, 326 women; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12, 4 studies, 235 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), and cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.58, 23 studies, 1265 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.27, 9 studies, 863 women, respectively; very low-quality evidence).Investigators reported few minor adverse events.Small improvements in physical activity interventions were sustained for three months or longer postintervention in fatigue (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.26; SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.11, respectively), cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69; SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79, respectively), and self-reported physical activity (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93, respectively) for both follow-up values and change from baseline scores.However, evidence of heterogeneity across trials was due to variation in intervention components (i.e. mode, frequency, intensity, duration of intervention and sessions) and measures used to assess outcomes. All trials reviewed were at high risk of performance bias, and most were also at high risk of detection, attrition, and selection bias. In light of the aforementioned issues, we determined that the evidence was of very low, low, or moderate quality. No conclusions regarding breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality or breast cancer recurrence were possible. However, physical activity interventions may have small-to-moderate beneficial effects on HRQoL, and on emotional or perceived physical and social function, anxiety, cardiorespiratory fitness, and self-reported and objectively measured physical activity. The positive results reported in the current review must be interpreted cautiously owing to very low-to-moderate quality of evidence, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, imprecision of some estimates, and risk of bias in many trials. Future studies with low risk of bias are required to determine the optimal combination of physical activity modes, frequencies, intensities, and durations needed to improve specific outcomes among women who have undergone adjuvant therapy.",breast_neoplasms

In MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, we investigated the influence of calcitriol and the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib on cell growth via the MTT test, as well as on the protein and mRNA expression of COX2 using western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was inhibited by both calcitriol and the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib and even more strongly by their combination. Moreover, calcitriol inhibited COX2 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as COX2 mRNA expression in both cell lines. The combination of calcitriol and celecoxib demonstrated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect in breast cancer cell lines.",breast_neoplasms
29374719,"Treatment strategies for patients with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have significantly progressed. The use of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor 2) protein, in combination with chemotherapy improves survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. S-1, an oral combination of fluorouracil derivatives, is widely used in Japan and is more convenient than intravenous drugs. However, little is known about the combination of S-1 and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive MBC. 2 received 120 mg, and the remaining received 100 mg daily in two divided doses. Trastuzumab was administered intravenously at 8 mg/kg on day 1 of the first cycle and at 6 mg/kg on day 1 of subsequent cycles, i.e., every 3 weeks. Between December 2008 and March 2013, 10 patients were enrolled and received a median of 17 (range=3-76) cycles of treatment. Overall response and clinical benefit rates were 60.0% and 90.0%, respectively. Progression-free survival was 15.8 (95% confidence interval=9.4-29.6) months and overall survival was 45.5 (95% confidence interval=37.1-62.2) months. Grade 3/4 adverse events included were neutropenia and hyperglycemia in one patient each (10.0%). There was no clinically significant cardiotoxicity. The combination of S-1 and trastuzumab was tolerable and had excellent efficacy with good response and disease control in this study.

The therapeutic efficacy of nCRT was analyzed in 41 ESCC patients randomized to the Surgery group (n=21) and the nCRT group (n=20). Lymph node specimens from patients were classified into two categories, micrometastasis (MM) and tumor cell microinvolvement (MI), after immunohistochemical evaluation. The incidence rates of patients presenting MM with or without MI or MI alone in the Surgery group were significantly higher than those in the nCRT group. The 10-year survival rate of 15 patients with simultaneous histological metastasis (HM) and LNM was significantly lower than that in the 26 patients without LNM. Within the nCRT group, the 10-year survival rates of patients with versus those without HM were not significantly different; however, the 10-year survival rate of the 5 patients with simultaneous HM and LNM was significantly lower than that of the 15 patients without LNM. ESCC patients with LNM may benefit from nCRT, and evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HM and LNM may facilitate accurate prediction of survival in ESCC patients.",breast_neoplasms
29374696,"Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), mainly adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), account for about 80% of all lung cancer cases. One of the proteins involved in NSCLC progression may be special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), a potent transcriptional regulator, able to control the expression of whole sets of genes simultaneously. SATB1 has been found to be associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in numerous malignancies, including breast, colon, ovary and prostate cancer. However, its role in NSCLC is still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of SATB1 protein and mRNA in NSCLC and non-malignant lung tissue (NMLT) samples, as well as to determine possible relationships of SATB1 expression with both the expression of Ki-67 and the clinicopathological data of the patients. The study was performed on 277 NSCLC (158 AC, 119 LSCC) and 20 NMLT samples. We observed increased SATB1 immunoreactivity in NSCLC when compared to NMLT, and in LSCC when compared to AC cases. We also noted that an elevated SATB1 immunoreactivity was associated with a poor degree of AC differentiation, whereas in LSCC, an inverse relationship was observed. Our analyses revealed that the expression of SATB1 positively correlated with Ki-67 index in NSCLC and LSCC, but not in AC cases. Finally, we found that high SATB1 expression was associated with a better overall survival of patients with NSCLC. SATB1 plays diverse roles in different NSCLC subtypes, and its expression may have a prognostic significance for patients with these tumours.",breast_neoplasms

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and the mechanism of action of free and liposome-encapsulated RRD4 in breast cancer. Liposome-encapsulated RRD4 prepared by thin-film dehydration: hydration and free RRD4 were tested in vivo and in vitro against 4T1 breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation, migration and viability were determined. Tissue and cell production and expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were assessed by ELISA and western blot. 4T1 cells treated with PEDF siRNA were evaluated for viability and apoptosis. RRD4 inhibited tumor growth and prevented distant metastasis. Liposome formulation enhanced this therapeutic benefit without increasing toxicity and prolonged RRD4 retention in tumor tissues. In vitro, RRD4 induced 4T1 apoptosis through up-regulation of FAS, BAX, and PUMA, and down-regulation of BCL2. RRD4 facilitates a FAS-intrinsic signaling mechanism. PEDF up-regulation represents another antitumor mechanism associated with this phosphaplatin compound.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative, cytotoxic and anti-metastatic effects of bulb and stem extracts from Allium autumnale P. H. Davis (Amaryllidaceae), an endemic Allium species to the island of Cyprus, in a comparative approach to weakly metastatic MCF-7 and strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (BCa) cell lines. Possible cytotoxic, anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of the Allium extracts on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were tested using trypan blue exclusion, MTT and wound heal assays, respectively. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis was performed to determine the prominent medically important compounds in Allium autumnale bulb (AAB) and Allium autumnale stem (AAS) extracts. Student unpaired t-test or ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis (INSTAT Software) was used where appropriate. Our results demonstrate that AAB extract (24, 48 and 72?h) exerts significant anti-proliferative effect on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells where this effect for AAS extract was observed only at high (5000 and 10,000???g/mL) concentrations. Cell viability experiments revealed that AAB extract incubations caused more cytotoxicity on both BCa cell lines compared to the AAS. In contrast, there was no effect on lateral motilities of either cell line.

29370205,"Diabetes and obesity seem to be partly overlapping risk factors for the development of obesity-related cancer (mainly breast, prostate and colorectal cancer) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the general population, women have a lower risk for obesity-related cancer compared to men. Previous studies involving cardiovascular disease have shown that T2DM eliminates a female advantage of lower CVD risk in the general population compared to men. It is unclear whether the same could be true for obesity-related cancer. This study aimed to this investigate obesity-related cancer incidence in women and men known with T2DM as compared to the Dutch general population. This study included 69,583 patients with T2DM selected from a prospective primary care cohort, which was linked to the Dutch National Cancer Registry to obtain cancer specific data. Obesity-related cancers included liver, kidney, colorectal, gallbladder, pancreas, ovarian, endometrial, advanced prostate cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Primary outcome was sex-stratified, age and year of cancer diagnosis adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for three time periods: 5 years before, the year after diagnosis and the next 4 years after T2DM diagnosis. The Dutch general population was used as reference group. Women with T2DM were at an increased risk for obesity-related cancer compared to women in the general population already 5 years before diabetes diagnosis (SIR 1.77; 95%CI: 1.63-1.91). In both men and women, there was a peak in obesity-related cancer incidence following diabetes diagnosis (SIR: 1.38; 95%CI 1.11-1.64 and SIR: 2.21; 95%CI 1.94-2.30, respectively). From the second to the fifth year after diabetes diagnosis the obesity-related cancer incidence was higher in women compared to women in the general population (SIR: 2.12; 95%CI 1.94-2.30). Women with T2DM seem to have a substantially higher obesity-related cancer risk. As opposed to men, in women this risk was already increased years before diabetes diagnosis. These results could imply that a relative advantage of women in the general population with regard to cancer risk is lost in women with T2DM.",breast_neoplasms

Tissue specimen from breast carcinoma patients were investigated for miRNAs-494, -205, -21 and -126. Prognostic associations for levels of miRNAs were analyzed based on complete clinical data and up to 22.5-year follow-up of the patient material (n?=?285). For detection of the miRNAs, an automated sensitive protocol applying in situ hybridization was developed. MiRNA-494 indicated prognostic value for patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Among node-negative disease reduced level of miRNA-494 predicted 8.5-fold risk of breast cancer death (p?=?0.04). Altered levels and expression patterns of the studied miRNAs were observed in breast carcinomas as compared to benign breast tissue. The present paper reports for the first time on the prognostic value of miRNA-494 in invasive breast cancer. Particularly, detection of miRNA-494 could benefit patients with node-negative breast cancer in identifying subgroups with aggressive disease. Based on our experience, the developed automatic ISH method to visualize altered levels of miRNAs-494, -205, -21 and -126 could be applied to routine pathology diagnostics providing that conditions of tissue treatment, especially fixation delays, are managed.",breast_neoplasms

This study was conducted to clarify the clinical implications of change of biomarker status in breast cancer patients treated with PST. The pre-chemotherapeutic biopsy and post-chemotherapeutic resection specimens of 442 breast cancer patients who had residual disease after PST were included in this study. The association between changes of biomarker status after PST and clinicopathologic features of tumors, and survival of the patients, were analyzed. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 status changed after PST in 18 (4.1%), 80 (18.1%), and 15 (3.4%) patients, respectively. ER and PR mainly underwent positive to negative conversion, whereas HER2 status underwent negative to positive conversion. Negative conversion of ER and PR status after PST was associated with reduced disease-free survival. Moreover, a decline in the Allred score for PR in post-PST specimens was significantly associated with poor clinical outcome of the patients. HER2 change did not have prognostic significance. In multivariate analyses, negative PR status after PST was found to be an independent adverse prognostic factor in the whole patient group, in the adjuvant endocrine therapy-treated subgroup, and also in pre-PST PR positive subgroup. ER and HER2 status changed little after PST, whereas PR status changed significantly. In particular, negative conversion of PR status was as a poor prognostic indicator, suggesting that re-evaluation of basic biomarkers is mandatory in breast cancer after PST for proper management and prognostication of patients.",breast_neoplasms

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to correlate BPE to patient and tumor characteristics in women with unilateral MRI-screen detected breast cancer who participated in an intermediate and high risk screening program. As BPE in the affected breast may be difficult to discern from enhancing cancer, we assumed that BPE in the contralateral breast is a representative measure for BPE in women with unilateral breast cancer. This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and a waiver for consent was granted. MR-examinations of women with unilateral breast cancers screen-detected on breast MRI were evaluated by two readers. BPE in the contralateral breast was rated according to BI-RADS. Univariate analyses were performed to study associations. Observer variability was computed. Analysis included 77 breast cancers in 76 patients (age: 48??9.8 years), including 62 invasive and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in-situ cases. A negative association between BPE and tumor grade (p??0.016) and a positive association with progesterone status (p??0.021) was found. The correlation was stronger when only considering invasive disease. Inter-reader agreement was substantial. Lower BPE in the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer might be associated to higher tumor grade and progesterone receptor negativity.

A within subjects' design was used. Participants (N?=?96) read either a breast cancer or heart disease message first, then completed a corresponding task that measured agreement or disagreement and confidence in the agreement or disagreement that 1) physical activity 'reduces risk/does not reduce risk' of breast cancer or heart disease, 2) that breast cancer or heart disease is a 'real/not real risk for me', 3) that women who get breast cancer or heart disease are 'like/not like me', and 4) that women who get breast cancer or heart disease are 'to blame/not to blame'. This task was followed by a questionnaire measuring message involvement and explicit believability. They then read the other disease messages and completed the corresponding agreement and confidence task and questionnaire measures. Lastly, participants completed a questionnaire measuring physical activity related attitudes and intentions, and demographics. There was no difference in message involvement or explicit believability of breast cancer compared to heart disease messages. Active participants had a higher confidence in their agreement that physical activity is preventive of heart disease compared to breast cancer. Multinomial regression models showed that, in addition to physical activity related attitudes and intentions, agreement that physical activity was preventive of heart disease and that women with heart disease are 'like me' were predictors of being more active compared to inactive. In the breast cancer model only attitudes and intentions predicted physical activity group. Active women likely internalized messages about heart disease prevention through physical activity, making the prevention messages more readily available within memory, and active women may therefore process such information differently. The study of how health-related beliefs are created and are related to perceptions of prevention messages is a rich area of study that may contribute to more effective health promotion.",breast_neoplasms

Diagnostic and demographic information for cancer registrations between 2000 and 2009 for 25-29 year olds was obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. Incidence rates (IR) and five-year relative survival estimates were calculated according to AYA diagnostic group/sub-group, sex and prioritised ethnicity. 1,541 new primary malignant cancers were diagnosed (IR: 588 per million). Five-year relative survival was 85%, but was significantly lower for M?ori and Pacific peoples (both 77%) compared to non-M?ori/non-Pacific peoples (88%). In the overall 15-29 year AYA cohort, disease-specific outcomes for bone tumours (46%) and breast cancer (64%) were inferior to international standards.

Concordance index and calibration curves were used to assess the effectiveness of nomogram. Case fatality rate of MBC was increasing (annual percentage change [APC], 21.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 46.3; p < 0.05) in the first 18 months and then decreased (APC, ?4.5; 95% CI, ?8.2 to ?0.7; p < 0.05). MFI, age, metastasis location, and hormone receptor status were independent prognostic factors and were included in the nomogram, which had a concordance index of 0.69 in the training cohort and 0.67 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves indicated good consistency between the two cohorts at 1 and 3 years. In conclusion, the fatality risk of MBC was increasing and reached the summit between 13th and 18th month after the detection of MBC. We have developed and validated a nomogram to predict the 1- and 3-year survival probability in MBC.",breast_neoplasms

Using two multicenter retrospective studies on breast cancer, a pooled analysis was performed among 320 patients with pT1-2N1 TNBC. All patients who underwent BCS (n=212) received whole breast RT with or without regional nodal RT, while none who underwent mastectomy (n=108) received it. All patients received taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up periods were 65 months in the BCS+RT group, and 74 months in the mastectomy group. The median age of all patients was 48 years (range, 24 to 70 years). Mastectomy group had more patients with multiple tumors (p < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p=0.001), higher number of involved lymph node (p=0.028), and higher nodal ratio ??0.2 (p=0.037).

There is, however, relatively limited real-world information about the effectiveness and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in Hong Kong Chinese patients. We assessed the efficacy and toxicity profiles among local patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who had received T-DM1 therapy in the second-line setting and beyond. This retrospective study involved five local centres that provide service for over 80% of the breast cancer population in Hong Kong. The study period was from December 2013 to December 2015. Patients were included if they had recurrent or metastatic histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer who had progressed after at least one line of anti-HER2 therapy including trastuzumab. Patients were excluded if they received T-DM1 as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. Patient charts including biochemical and haematological profiles were reviewed for background information, T-DM1 response, and toxicity data. Adverse events were documented during chemotherapy and 28 days after the last dose of medication. Among 37 patients being included in this study, 28 (75.7%) had two or more lines of anti-HER2 agents and 26 (70.3%) had received two or more lines of palliative chemotherapy. Response assessment revealed that three (8.1%) patients had a complete response, eight (21.6%) a partial response, 11 (29.7%) a stable disease, and 12 (32.4%) a progressive disease; three patients could not be assessed. The median duration of response was 17.3 (95% confidence interval, 8.4-24.8) months.

However, the magnitude and the temporal nature of this association remain unclear. Data from two large prospective population-based case-control studies, the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (MECC, n = 8,383) and the Breast Cancer in Northern Israel Study (BCINIS, n = 11,608), were used to better understand the nature and temporality of a possible association between cancer diagnosis and AF events before and after cancer diagnosis. A case-control study approach was employed to study prior AF as a risk factor for cancer, and a cohort study approach was employed to study incident cancer as a risk factor for AF. AF was associated with a significant reduced odds of cancer as reflected in the case-control approach, with an adjusted OR = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91), while cancer was not found to be significantly associated with elevated risk of AF in the cohort approach, with an adjusted HR = 1.10 (0.98-1.23). The immediate period (90 days) after an AF event was associated with a 1.85 times increased risk of cancer, and the immediate period after the diagnosis of cancer was associated with a 3.4 fold increased risk of AF. These findings probably reflect both the effect of acute transient conditions associated with new cancer diagnosis and detection bias. Similar results were identified with colorectal and breast cancer cases. Atrial fibrillation of longer than 90 days duration is associated with reduced odds of new cancer diagnosis. The results of this study suggest that an association observed in prior research may be due to instances related to cancer diagnosis and detection bias rather than a causal relationship. However, there may be bias in the sampling and residual confounding that distort the associations.",breast_neoplasms

A Phase I/II study was designed to understand the tolerability and efficacy of this combination treatment. Female MBC patients with HER2 positive were eligible. Lapatinib was given once daily and oral vinorelbine was given on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. A 3 + 3 standard dose-escalation rule was applied in the Phase I study. The primary endpoint of the Phase II study was PFS. In the Phase II part, because no DLT was observed in the first 20 patients, vinorelbine dose-escalation was permitted if no significant toxicities after the first cycle was observed. From June 2009 to February 2013, 46 patients were enrolled in Phase I (n = 15) and II (n = 31) studies. Median age was 52.8 (range 34.3-84.0); 28 (60.9%) patients were ER positive. In the Phase I study, two patients had DLTs (neutropenia (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 1)). The MTD was determined at lapatinib 1000 mg plus oral vinorelbine 50 mg/m2. In the Phase II study, 11 patients safely had vinorelbine escalated to 60 mg/m2 on cycle 2.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are the most common cause of hereditary breast cancer. In this report we describe a Croatian patient with no apparent family history of cancer, who developed breast cancer first at 29, and again at 33. Due to the early development of first breast cancer and triple negative status of the second, the attending physician suspected a hereditary aspect. Patient was sent to BRCA1 genetic testing. Subsequently, her mother and sister were sent to check for the mutation found in the patient. BRCA1 exons 4-6 deletion was determined and sequencing confirmed the deletion as NG_005905.2:g.107648_117905del10257. Mother and sister were not affected, but since there were no available family members on the fathers' side, it was not possible to determine if this was a case of de novo mutation. Until now, only in three reports with the similar mutation the exact mutation borders were determined. The mutation in this case was not the same as previously reported and was more than twice in size. All large deletions should be described at the nucleotide level, so that in cases with missing family data it would be possible to deduce if the mutation is already known. If the mutation is already known, it is probably not a de novo event, since it is unlikely that the breakpoints would be exactly the same more than once.",breast_neoplasms

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of postmastectomy radiotherapy following primary systemic treatment. Between 2005 and 2012, in two independent institutions, female patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer receiving primary systemic treatment followed by mastectomy and lymph node dissection because bad response, then treated with or without chest wall and regional lymph node irradiation have been studied retrospectively. The patients received normofractionated radiotherapy using 3D conformal photons or electron techniques. Locoregional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival and disease-free survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of potential prognostic factors was performed using log-rank test. Eighty-eight patients have been studied. Of them, 75 patients received postmastectomy radiotherapy. At surgery, 53 patients achieved ypN0. Median follow-up was 67 months. Postmastectomy radiotherapy significantly improved locoregional recurrence-free survival, with a 5-year rate of 96.9% versus 78.6% in the group that did not have postmastectomy radiotherapy. In the subgroup of 53 patients achieving ypN0, postmastectomy radiotherapy improved locoregional recurrence-free survival (a 5-year rate of 94.7% vs. 72.9%), distant metastasis-free survival (a 5-year rate of 92.8% vs. 75%) and disease-free survival (a 5-year rate of 92.9% vs. 62.5%). By univariate analysis, postmastectomy radiotherapy was the only significant prognostic factor affecting locoregional recurrence-free survival. For patients with clinical T1-2N1 disease, postmastectomy radiotherapy could significantly improve locoregional recurrence-free survival after primary systemic treatment and be even more therapeutic in the subgroup of patients with good response for primary systemic treatment by improving locoregional recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free and disease-free survival.

We also reported the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the investigations that included mammography, ultrasonography, ductography, and cytology. We identified 71 and 31 patients in the benign and malignant subgroups, respectively. The median age at presentation for the benign subgroup was younger than that of the malignant subgroup (48 vs 59 years; P=0.003). A higher proportion of patients in the malignant subgroup than the benign subgroup presented with blood-stained nipple discharge (87.1% vs 47.9%; P=0.002). Mammography had a specificity of 98.4% and positive predictive value of 66.7%; ultrasonography had a specificity of 87.0% and negative predictive value of 75.0%. Cytology and ductography were sensitive but lacked specificity. Ductography had a negative predictive value of 100% but a low positive predictive value (14.0%). Clinical variables including age at presentation, duration of discharge, colour of discharge, presence of an associated breast mass, and abnormal sonographic findings were important in suggesting the underlying pathology of nipple discharge.

29285039,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy beyond standard treatment for anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We consecutively enrolled 158 MBC patients who underwent CMF chemotherapy in a palliative setting at two academic hospitals in Korea between 2002 and 2016. The median age of the 158 enrolled patients was 51 years (range, 30-77 years). The enrolled patients were treated with a median of 5 lines of systemic treatment (range, 2-11) before CMF therapy, and the median time from diagnosis of MBC to CMF administration was 36.0 months (range, 7.1-146.7 months). The median number of cycles of CMF treatment was 3 (range, 1-19), and the relative dose intensity was 90.4%. The toxicity profile was mild, with an observed 3.1% of grade 2 and 5.0% of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Among 147 patients (93.0%) whose response to CMF was evaluated, the response rate was 10.9% (16/147), with complete response (CR) in one and partial response (PR) in 15. In addition, the disease control rate (calculated as CR+PR+stable disease) was 44.2% (65/147). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-3.6) and 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.1-11.6), respectively.

29285037,"We examined associations between a family history of breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women who received or did not receive radiotherapy. Our study included 2,440 women enrolled in the Breast Cancer Registry of Greater Cincinnati. Information on breast cancer risk factors, including detailed family history of breast cancer, characteristics of the primary tumor, treatment received, and recurrence status was collected at baseline and via updates. Associations between a family history of breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer recurrence were examined separately in women treated with and without radiotherapy using survival analysis. Over an average follow-up time of 8.78 years, we found no associations between a family history of breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer recurrence among women with a history of radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.23). Among women who did not receive radiotherapy, the total number of relatives with breast cancer was positively associated with the risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.47). We found no interactions of radiotherapy with family history (p-interaction >0.05). Radiotherapy for a primary breast cancer in women with a family history of breast cancer does not increase risk of breast cancer recurrence. If these findings are replicated in future studies, the results may translate into an important health message for breast cancer survivors with a family history of breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29284222,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly-diagnosed cancers. There is much evidence showing the influence of life style and environmental factors on the development of mammary gland cancer (high-fat diet, alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise), the elimination of which (primary prevention) may contribute to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. Secondary prevention, comprising diagnostic tests (e.g. mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, breast self-examination, as well as modern and more precise imaging methods) help the early detection of tumours or lesions predisposing to tumours. The aim of this study paper is to review current knowledge and reports regarding primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer. It is estimated that nearly 70% of malign tumours are caused by environmental factors, whereas in breast cancer this percentage reaches 90-95%. There are national programmes established in many countries to fight cancer, where both types of prevention are stressed as serving to decrease morbidity and mortality due to cancers. Cancer prevention is currently playing a key role in the fight against the disease. Behaviour modification, as well as greater awareness among women regarding breast cancer, may significantly contribute towards reducing the incidence of this cancer. Another important aspect is the number of women undergoing diagnostic tests, which still remains at an unsatisfactory level.",breast_neoplasms

Eligible patients had undergone breast conservative surgery for early breast cancer (pTis-2) and none/limited nodal involvement. Hypo-WBI consisted of 34?Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2?weeks to the whole breast three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), followed by a single fraction of 8?Gy to the tumor bed after 1?week (electrons). Primary endpoint is freedom from ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Minimum follow up for living & event-free patients is 3?yrs.; median follow up time of the whole analyzed patient population is 5.4?yrs. (range: 1.8-11.4?yrs). Two hundred fifty-one patients were accrued from 2004 to 2013. All patients underwent local excision of the primary tumor to negative margins. Four patients failed in the ipsilateral breast after a median time of 3.2?years (range: 1.7-5.7?yrs) for a 5-year IBTR-free survival of 98.7% (95%CI: 97.3%-100%). IBTR-free survival was significantly higher for patients with invasive cancer than for patients with intraductal carcinoma (p?=?0.036). Within patients with invasive tumors, no clear trends or associations were detected between IBTR and age, grading, molecular subtype, pT or pN stage. At 5?years, the actuarial rates of GR2 fibrosis and GR2+ teleangectasia are 2.4% (95%CI: 0-6.5%) and 7.1% (95%CI: 0.4-13.7%), respectively. Cosmesis was scored as excellent/good by ?95% of patients and ?60% of clinicians. Hypo-WBI in 3?weeks allows excellent oncologic outcomes for invasive breast cancer after conservative surgery.

All patients undergoing percutaneous core biopsies in interventional radiology (IR) with samples evaluated for a 46-gene NGS panel during 1-year were included in this retrospective study. Patient and procedure variables were collected. An imaging-based likelihood of adequacy score incorporating targeting and sampling factors was assigned to each biopsied lesion. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. 153 patients were included (58.2% female, average age 59.5 years). The most common malignancy was lung cancer (40.5%), most common biopsied site was lung (36%), and average size of biopsied lesions was 3.8 cm (+/- 2.7). Adequacy for NGS was 69.9%. Univariate analysis showed higher likelihood of adequacy score (p = 0.004), primary malignancy type (p = 0.03), and absence of prior systemic therapy (p = 0.018) were associated with adequacy for NGS. Multivariate analysis showed higher adequacy for lesions with likelihood of adequacy scored 3 (high) versus lesions scored 1 (low) (OR, 7.82; p = 0.002). Melanoma lesions had higher adequacy for NGS versus breast cancer lesions (OR 9.5; p = 0.01). Absence of prior systemic therapy (OR, 6.1; p = 0.02) and systemic therapy </ = 3 months (OR 3.24; p = 0.01) compared to systemic therapy >3 months before biopsy yielded greater adequacy for NGS. Lesions <3 cm had greater adequacy for NGS than larger lesions (OR 2.72, p = 0.02). As targeted therapy becomes standard for more cancers, percutaneous biopsy specimens adequate for NGS genomic testing will be needed.

It is a cytotoxic agent with unique mechanisms that suppress the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells and promote tumor vascular remodeling. In this study, we investigated the expression of markers for EMT and hypoxia in sets of clinical specimens collected before and after eribulin treatment to verify its unique mechanisms. The expression of markers for EMT and cellular hypoxia [E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9)] was examined immunohistochemically in MBC tissues collected from 20 patients before and after chemotherapy with either eribulin (n=10) or paclitaxel (n=10). An increase of E-cadherin and decrease of CA9 expression were observed in MBC tissues from patients with objective clinical responses to eribulin treatment. Patients with E-cadherin-positive conversion and CA9-negative conversion had significantly higher response rates (p=0.004 and p=0.024, respectively) and prolonged time to treatment failure (p=0.018 and p=0.038, respectively) than patients without changes in marker expression.

Functional in vivo and in vitro assays were used to study the temporal evolution of their anticancer effects. Highly therapeutic antitumor memory was generated by viral oncolytic immunotherapy 30 days after treatment and matured to maximal potency at 100 days. Maturation was not uniform across different measures. The results provide guidelines for developing a viral oncolytic vaccine strategy to generate antitumor memory T-cells that can eliminate small nests of metastatic cancer cells in sanctuary sites and prevent emergence of tumors from dormant cancer cell collections.

We evaluated clinical practices and outcomes with respect to radiation therapy in MBC treated with locoregional irradiation in the adjuvant setting using a systematic literature review. We included studies with data about adjuvant radiotherapy published between 1984 and 2017 and including at least 40 patients. We found 29 retrospective series, 10,065 men were diagnosed with breast cancer; 3-100% (mean=54%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Tumor size and nodal involvement were the strongest prognostic factors. Approximatively half of all cases had nodal metastases. Radiation therapy improved locoregional control in six series, overall survival in three and distant metastasis-free survival in one. MBC is diagnosed at a highly advanced stage and may be linked with poorer outcomes. Adjuvant radiation therapy must, at least, be proposed to men with positive nodes. Despite the large number of cases gathered here, arguments for radiotherapy in other prognostic subgroups (especially in pN0) may exist but are not well supported.",breast_neoplasms

29271212,"Axillary dissection (AD) is an integral part of the surgical staging of breast cancer. This operation can be source of major long term complications, e. g., lymphedema. Reducing the radicality of these operations has been the subject of many clinical trials, especially those addressing the metastatic infiltration of axillary lymph nodes uncovered either by clinical staging or by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (when the clinical staging was negative). Exact clinical (mainly ultrasonographic) staging and marking of the lymph nodes detected by staging plays a key role in deciding the optimum clinical regimen. Three possibilities were tested in clinical trials: The possibility of replacing the AD by radiotherapy in the case of tumorous infiltration of SLN, when clinical staging was negative; the possibility of omitting AD (in patients with positive clinical axillary staging) and replacing it with SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; and the possibility of marking lymph nodes in axilla that were suspected of infiltration at the time of clinical staging. The studies showed clear evidence that avoiding AD was safe in oncology patients who showed infiltration of axillary SLN and negative clinical staging. Despite the high false negativity of using SLN biopsies in patients with a positive clinical staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, this false negativity could be reduced by using lymph node marking. By implementing these methods, it should be possible to define exactly the group of patients in whom complete pathological remission occurs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Key words: breast neoplasms - axilla - lymph nodes The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

In this study, RNA-Seq of 33 breast specimens was performed, and the expression of linc00152 was validated by qPCR using 50 paired breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. This result combined with the expression of linc00152 in pan-cancer was revalidated by Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Next, the oncogenic roles of linc00152 in view of prognosis, chemoresistance, genomic and epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation and histone modification, potential biological function enrichment, and basic molecular function in pan-cancer, were also evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Linc00152 is upregulated in pan-cancer, especially in progressive cancer, and the high expression of linc00152 may lead to a worse prognosis and chemoresistance in pan-cancer patients. Amplification, DNA hypomethylation, promoter-like lncRNA characteristics and super-enhancer regulation are the drivers that lead to the upregulation of linc00152 in pan-cancer. Meanwhile, linc00152 was involved in cancer-related pathways, infection and immune response-associated pathways by enriched analysis using TCGA data. Finally, linc00152 was confirmed to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231, SGC-7901 and 786-O. Moreover, RIP and RNA pull-down assays indicated that linc00152 can bind to EZH2 directly.

Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-453, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown.

29246220,"Various plant extracts have been suggested to be used as auxiliary agents in chemotherapy considering their anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells. However, recent reports reveal that plant extracts may function as inducers of autophagy of cancer cells. In general, autophagy confers survival advantage for cells responding to stress conditions, thus representing an important mechanism for chemo-resistance. This study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of combined use of Salidroside (Sal, a phenylpropanoid glycosides from Rhodiola rosea L) with anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, and moreover to evaluate the potential role of autophagy in the combined therapy. CRC cells, HCT-116, were incubated with Sal alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents including oxaliplatin (OXA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Doxorubicin (ADM). Cell proliferative characteristics were evaluated by cell viability and apoptosis rate. The protein expression was assessed by Immunofluorescent and Western blot assays. Sal, alone or in combination with anti-tumor agents, increased expression of autophagic biomarkers, including LC3B and Becline-1, suggesting an autophagy induction. Except for the up-regulation of p-AMPK, p-mTOR, p-NF-??B (p65), TGF-??, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were down-regulated by Sal. Because autophagy is positively correlated with the activation of AMPK/mTOR, NF-??B, TGF??1 and JAK2/STAT3 cascades, the autophagy induced by Sal may associate with AMPK activation. Indeed, blockage of AMPK signaling via Compound C or AMPK knockdown inhibited the autophagy. The blockage of AMPK signaling or a direct inhibition of autophagy via 3-MA increased effectiveness of combined use of Sal with anti-tumor agents against CRC. Inhibition of autophagy enhances synergistic effects of Sal and anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer. This study provides experimental evidence and theoretical reference for improvement of a novel chemotherapy treatment protocol.",breast_neoplasms

Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n?=?110) and without (n?=?160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P?<?.001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints.

The expression levels of HER2, HER3, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR and p-mTOR were examined in specimens from 120 GC patients by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The associations of HER proteins, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related proteins, clinicopathological features of GC, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. To comprehensively evaluate the prognostic values of pathway-related proteins, meta-analyses were conducted with STATA 11.0. HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with HER3 levels (P?=?0.02). HER3 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues. High HER2 and HER3 levels were associated with elevated p-Akt and p-mTOR amounts (P?<?0.05). Furthermore, HER2-HER3 co-expression was associated with high p-Akt and p-mTOR (P?<?0.05) levels. Meanwhile, p-mTOR overexpression was tightly associated with differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and OS (P?<?0.05). By meta-analyses, Akt, p-Akt, and mTOR levels were unrelated to clinicopathological characters. HER3 overexpression was associated with depth of invasion (OR?=?2.39, 95%CI 1.62-3.54, P?<?0.001) and lymph node metastasis (OR?=?2.35, 95%CI 1.34-4.11, P?=?0.003). Further, p-mTOR overexpression was associated with patient age, tumor location, depth of invasion (OR?=?1.63, 95%CI 1.08-2.45, P?=?0.02) and TNM stage (OR?=?1.73, 95%CI 1.29-2.32, P?<?0.001). In addition, HER2-HER3 overexpression corresponded to gradually shortened 5-year OS (P?<?0.05), and significant relationships were shown among HER3, p-mTOR overexpression, and 1-, 3-, 5-year OS (P?<?0.05).

29231164,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, which accounts for 20?-?25% of cases of breast cancers, is highly aggressive. Due to cardiotoxicity and increasing resistance associated with trastuzumab, the first-line treatment, there is a need for effective second-line therapies in treating HER2-positive breast cancer. In this context, there has been increasing interest in the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of lapatinib plus capecitabine for HER2-positive breast cancer after progression with trastuzumab therapy, in comparison with capecitabine monotherapy and other agents such as vinorelbine and trastuzumab emtansine. We performed a keyword search in five electronic databases (OVID MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL; January 2010 to April 2017) for trials in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that has progressed on trastuzumab. After screening, the relevant studies were assessed for their methodological quality (including selection bias, randomization, control for confounders, and blinding) by two reviewers independently. A total of 50 studies were identified; only 6 of those met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Five received a weak rating on the quality assessment tool, and none could be considered as being of high scientific quality after taking the risk of bias and other confounding variables into account. The studies demonstrated that lapatinib plus capecitabine is effective in extending median overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes, achieving OS of 37.6?-?108.7 weeks and PFS of 21.1?-?30 weeks across studies. However, median OS and PFS for trastuzumab emtansine therapy were found to be considerably better (133.9?weeks and 41.6?weeks, respectively) than for lapatinib plus capecitabine. The results suggest that the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine can improve PFS and OS in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that has progressed on trastuzumab. However, it appears that trastuzumab emtansine provides better treatment outcomes in this context.?.",breast_neoplasms

As therapeutic options for solid tumors improve, the rate of LMD continues to increase. Until recently, treatment has been limited to radiation therapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, with an overall survival of 2-3 months. Targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies are promising new options for increasing overall survival and clinical improvement; however, optimal clinical management remains unknown. In this review, we discuss targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapy treatment options for LMD resulting from primary lung, breast, and melanoma tumors. In addition, we summarize dosing strategies, overall survival, clinical outcomes, and novel approaches to treatment. Our review indicates a deficiency in the current literature. Presently, intrathecal trastuzumab administration may be an effective option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. BRAF inhibitors and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 targets have shown promising results in LMD resulting from melanoma. Finally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors may increase overall survival in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Pulsatile drug administration or dual therapy may be beneficial for patients who progress to LMD while being treated with EGFR targets for their primary malignancy. Targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapy in LMD may provide favorable treatment options. Current literature is lacking in safety, efficacy, and overall response rates from the use of targeted therapy.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can downstage tumors, broadening BCS eligibility in patients requiring mastectomy. However, tumor downstaging does not obviate need for RT. This study evaluated factors that predict RT omission after NACT and BCS. The National Cancer Database was queried for women with unilateral, clinical stage II-III breast cancer, treated with NACT and BCS between 2008 and 2012. Patients not receiving RT after NACT and BCS were identified. A subgroup analysis was performed eliminating patients for whom RT was recommended but not received. Among 10,220 patients meeting study eligibility, 974 (9.53%) did not receive RT after BCS. Predictors of RT omission included older age, insurance status, facility type, facility region, more recent year of diagnosis, receptor status unknown, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status positive or unknown, and positive margins. Factors increasing the likelihood of RT receipt included cN3 disease, receptor positivity, and primary downstaging. Race, Hispanicity, education, income, comorbidities, rural versus urban setting, histology, grade, and nodal stage change were not associated with RT omission. When excluding the 314 patients for whom RT was recommended but not received, age, Medicaid insurance, facility type, facility region, receptor status unknown, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status unknown, and positive margins were predictors of RT omission. Race, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status were not predictors of RT omission. It remains unclear whether omission of RT in some cases is due to lack of physician knowledge.

However, the precise roles of Osx in breast cancer remain unclear. Drug sensitivity of the cancer cells was assessed using an 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Target genes were obtained by high-throughput Illumina sequencing and were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis was analysed by Hoechst staining and western blotting. A tissue microarray including 129 samples from breast cancer patients was used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Overexpression of Osx decreased the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells, while knockdown of Osx increased the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells. In particular, we found that the decreased chemosensitivity effect was significantly associated with elevated expression of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14 (GALNT14). Silencing of GALNT14 in Osx-overexpressed cells restored the decreased chemosensitivity. Conversely, overexpression of GALNT14 in Osx-knockdown cells abrogated the increased chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells. In addition, we revealed that Osx decreased GALNT14-dependent chemosensitivity by enhancing anti-apoptosis. GALNT14 expression exhibited a significant association with breast cancer stages as well as the disease-free survival (DFS) rate. Osx plays an important role in the chemosensitivity and inhibition of Osx expression may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance the chemosensitivity of breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

In younger patients with cancer, muscle mass and radiodensity are associated with treatment toxicity and OS. In this study, we investigated whether muscle mass, radiodensity, and strength were associated with treatment toxicity and OS in patients with advanced cancer aged 60 years or older. Before starting palliative chemotherapy, muscle mass and radiodensity were assessed using computed tomography scans and muscle strength was assessed using a hydraulic hand grip dynamometer. Treatment toxicity was defined as any toxicity resulting in dose reduction and/or discontinuation of treatment. Multiple logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to study potential associations of muscle mass, radiodensity, and strength with treatment toxicity and OS, respectively. The participants were 103 patients, with a mean age of 70 years, with advanced colorectal, prostate, or breast cancer. Muscle parameters were not significantly associated with treatment toxicity. Higher muscle strength was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.05). Muscle mass and radiodensity were not significantly associated with OS. Higher muscle strength at the start of palliative chemotherapy is associated with significantly better OS in older patients with advanced cancer. None of the investigated muscle parameters were related to treatment toxicity. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether muscle strength can be used for treatment decisions in older patients with advanced cancer. This study in older patients with advanced cancer showed that adequate muscle strength is associated with longer overall survival.

This study aims to validate exosomal microRNA-1246 (miR-1246) as a serum biomarker for breast cancer and understand the underlying mechanism in breast cancer progression. The expression levels of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR, and the expression level of the target protein was detected by western blot. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy were used to characterize exosomes and to study their uptake and transfer. Luciferase reporter plasmids and its mutant were used to confirm direct targeting. Furthermore, the functional significance of exosomal miR-1246 was estimated by invasion assay and cell viability assay. In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes carrying microRNA can be transferred among different cell lines through direct uptake. miR-1246 is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells compared to non-metastatic breast cancer cells or non-malignant breast cells. Moreover, miR-1246 can suppress the expression level of its target gene, Cyclin-G2 (CCNG2), indicating its functional significance. Finally, treatment with exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells could enhance the viability, migration and chemotherapy resistance of non-malignant HMLE cells.

NDL elicited a two-stage response in MCF-7 treated cells with apoptosis as the ultimate result. The various mechanisms inducing apoptosis reflected the complexity of the formula composition.",breast_neoplasms
29202666,"The current study evaluates the data quality achievable using a national data bank for reporting radiotherapy parameters relative to the classical manual reporting method of selected parameters. The data comparison is based on 1522 Danish patients of the DBCG hypo trial with data stored in the Danish national radiotherapy data bank. In line with standard DBCG trial practice selected parameters were also reported manually to the DBCG database. Categorical variables are compared using contingency tables, and comparison of continuous parameters is presented in scatter plots. For categorical variables 25 differences between the data bank and manual values were located. Of these 23 were related to mistakes in the manual reported value whilst the remaining two were a wrong classification in the data bank. The wrong classification in the data bank was related to lack of dose information, since the two patients had been treated with an electron boost based on a manual calculation, thus data was not exported to the data bank, and this was not detected prior to comparison with the manual data. For a few database fields in the manual data an ambiguity of the parameter definition of the specific field is seen in the data. This was not the case for the data bank, which extract all data consistently. In terms of data quality the data bank is superior to manually reported values. However, there is a need to allocate resources for checking the validity of the available data as well as ensuring that all relevant data is present. The data bank contains more detailed information, and thus facilitates research related to the actual dose distribution in the patients.",breast_neoplasms
29202630,"Myriad reports suggest that frequently used prescription drugs alter the viability of breast cancer cells in pre-clinical studies. Routine use of these drugs, therefore, may impact breast cancer prognosis, and could have important implications for public health. The Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) clinical database provides high-quality prospectively collected data on breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and routine follow-up for breast cancer recurrence. Individual-level linkage of DBCG data to other population-based and medical registries in Denmark, including the Danish National Prescription Registry, has facilitated large population-based pharmacoepidemiology studies. A unique advantage of using DBCG data for such studies is the ability to investigate the association of drugs with breast cancer recurrence rather than breast cancer mortality - which may be misclassified - or all-cause mortality. Here we summarize findings from pharmacoepidemiological studies, based on DBCG data, on the association between routinely used prescription drugs and risk of breast cancer recurrence. Our findings suggest that concurrent use of glucocorticoids, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, digoxin, and opioids has little impact on breast cancer recurrence. Similarly, patients who use SSRIs concurrently with tamoxifen treatment are not at increased risk of recurrence. In contrast, post-diagnostic use of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, correlates with a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence, providing a rationale for a prospective randomized clinical trial investigating simvastatin as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. As a whole, findings of pharmacoepidemiological studies based on DBCG data provide reassurance to physicians and healthcare personnel who provide supportive care during and after cancer (including prescriptions for comedications) and to breast cancer survivors for whom the risk of breast cancer recurrence is a major concern.",breast_neoplasms

This population-based analysis aimed to describe the plurality of modifications introduced over the past 10 years in the national Danish guidelines for the management of early breast cancer. By use of the clinical DBCG database we analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of guideline revisions in Denmark. From the DBCG guidelines we extracted modifications introduced in 2007-2016 and selected examples regarding surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and systemic treatment. We assessed introduction of modifications from release on the DBCG webpage to change in clinical practice using the DBCG clinical database. Over a 10-year period data from 48,772 patients newly diagnosed with malignant breast tumors were entered into DBCG's clinical database and 42,197 of these patients were diagnosed with an invasive carcinoma following breast conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. More than twenty modifications were introduced in the guidelines. Implementations, based on prospectively collected data, varied widely; exemplified with around one quarter of the patients not treated according to a specific guideline within one year from the introduction, to an almost immediate full implantation. Modifications of the DBCG guidelines were generally well implemented, but the time to full implementation varied from less than one year up to around five years. Our data is registry based and does not allow a closer analysis of the causes for delay in implementation of guideline modifications.",breast_neoplasms
29202611,"Cell culture studies have disclosed that the mitotic Aurora kinase A is causally involved in both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor resistant cell growth and thus may be a potential new marker for endocrine resistance in the clinical setting. Archival tumor tissue was available from 1323 Danish patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive primary breast cancer, who participated in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, comparing treatment with tamoxifen and letrozole and both in a sequence. The expression of Aurora A was determined by immunohistochemistry in 980 tumors and semi quantitively scored into three groups; negative/weak, moderate and high. The Aurora A expression levels were compared to other clinico-pathological parameters and outcome, defined as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). High expression of Aurora A was found in 26.9% of patients and moderate in 57.0%. High expression was significantly associated with high malignancy grade and HER2 amplification. High Aurora A expression was significantly more frequent in ductal compared to lobular carcinomas. We found no significant association between Aurora A expression and DFS or OS and no evidence of interaction between Aurora A expression and benefits from tamoxifen versus letrozole. Aurora A expression in breast tumors was associated with high malignancy grade III and with HER2 amplification. A trend as a prognostic factor for OS was found in patients with high Aurora A expression. No predictive property was observed in this study with early breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

This study examined whether screenings of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer impact early-stage cancer incidence and mortality in Missouri. This is an ecological study based on county-specific estimates of selected cancer screening prevalence and early-stage cancer incidence and cancer mortality. County-specific prevalence of clinical breast examination, mammography, Pap test, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) were generated from Missouri County-Level Study (2003, 2007, and 2011). County-specific crude incidence and mortality were calculated (2004-2013). Pearson's correlation and Poisson regression were used to test association between cancer rate and screening prevalence. Covariates included county-level mean age, percentage of whites, percentage with low income, percentage with less than high school education?high school, percentage with no insurance, and percentage having difficulties accessing care. In the adjusted model, 'ever had Pap test' was significantly associated with an increase of 8% in early-stage cervical cancer incidence. Having clinical breast examination or Pap test in the past was also associated with decreases in mortality by 3% and 4%, respectively, although the association was not significant for Pap test. In addition, having mammography was statistically significantly associated with early-stage breast cancer incidence, and having FOBT or sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was associated with decreased colorectal cancer mortality; however, magnitude for these associations was only around 1%. This study provides ecological evidence of the effectiveness of screening services in predicting early stage cancer incidence and in reducing mortality across Missouri counties.

29196053,"Angiogenesis is a recognized hallmark of cancer which promotes cancer cell progression and metastasis. Inhibition of angiogenesis to attenuate cancer growth is becoming desirable strategy for breast cancer management. The present study is aimed to investigate the antiangiogenic efficacy of a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator Centchroman (CC) on human breast cancer cells. Effect of CC on cell viability was evaluated using Sulforhodamine B assay. Endothelial cell proliferation, wound healing, Boyden chamber cell invasion, tube formation and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays were performed to assess the effect of CC on migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Apoptosis, reactive oxygen species generation, caspase-3/7 and intracellular calcium ion level were measured through flow cytometry. Expression levels of HIF-1??, VEGF, VEGFR2, AKT and ERK were assessed by western blot analysis. CC selectively induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells without affecting non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells MCF-10A. Moreover, it inhibits migratory, invasive and mammosphere forming potential of breast cancer. Furthermore, CC also inhibited VEGF-induced migration, invasion and tube formation of HUVECs in vitro. CC effectively inhibited neovasculature formation in chicken CAM. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CC inhibited expression of HIF-1?? and its downstream target VEGF. Interestingly, CC also suppressed VEGFR2 phosphorylation and consequently attenuated AKT and ERK phosphorylation",breast_neoplasms
29190865,"Low-penetrance susceptibility genes such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) have been considered in the progression of breast cancer (BC). Cancer is a result of genetic, environmental and epigenetic interactions; therefore, these genes should be studied in environmental context, because the results can vary between populations and even within the same country. The objective was to analyze the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the MTHFR C667T SNP in Mexican Mestizo patients with BC and controls from Northeastern Mexico. 243 patients and 118 healthy women were studied. The analysis of the polymorphism was performed with a DNA microarray. Once the frequency of the polymorphism was obtained, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was carried out for the genotypes. Chi square test was used to compare the distribution of frequencies. The allele frequency in patients was: C = 0.5406; T = 0.4594 and in controls C = 0.5678, T = 0.4322. Genotype in BC patients was: C / C = 29.9%, C / T = 48.3% and T / T = 21.8. The distribution in controls was: C / C = 31.4%, C / T = 50.8%, T / T = 17.8% (chi squared 0.77, p = 0.6801). Northeastern Mexican women in this study showed no association between MTFHR C667T SNP and the risk of BC.

We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study of 220 patients treated in the Department of Senology at the University Hospital Aristide Le Dantec, Dakar over the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. 220 patients out of 984 consultants had benign tumor of the breast (22.5%). Benign tumors of the breast accounted for 58.2% of tumor pathologies. The average age was 24 years. The age group 11-30 years was the most represented (70%). The quasi-totality of patients were women of childbearing age (95%), 58.6% were nulliparous women. The main reason for consultation was a breast mass in 94.5% of cases. The left side was most often affected (49.5%), especially the upper outer quadrant (41.6%). 145 patients (65.9% of cases) underwent ultrasound. Cytologic examination showed conjunctival epithelial hyperplasia in almost all cases (96.1%). 44 women underwent histologic examination, which confirmed the histologic nature of the lesions. Fibroadenoma and fibrocystic changes were the most retained diagnoses, accounting for 86.3% and 5.9% respectively. 28 patients (12.7%) underwent lumpectomy, all tumor types were taken together. The majority of patients had follow-up appointments within 3 months, with favorable outcome. Benign tumors are very frequent in senology consultations. The recommended diagnostic approach combines the clinico-radio-cytological triad and, in case of doubt or discrepancy, biopsy or surgical resection are essential.

The aims of this work were to study the associations and the prognostic value of AR in patients from two clinical cohorts. Cohort 1 included 208 premenopausal, node-negative patients of whom 87% had received no adjuvant medical treatment; cohort 2 consisted of 263 patients with stage II disease who had all received 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. A semi-quantitative assessment of nuclear AR expression divided into five groups (0-1%, 2-10%, 11-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%) was performed. Survival analyses, stratified by cohort, were performed using both a trend-test and a cut-off of >10% for positivity. A total of 76% of all patients were AR+, and 89%, 48%, and 23% of the estrogen receptor-positive, negative, and triple-negative, respectively. In Cox regression, stratified by cohort, AR divided into five groups was a prognostic factor for 5-year distant disease-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.86 per step in fraction score (p=0.018). With a predefined cut-off at 10%, moderate evidence of an effect remained (Hazard Ratio=0.67, p=0.077). In multivariable analysis, AR did not retain an independent prognostic value. AR is a weak, however, not independent prognostic factor for distant metastasis. Although the prognostic value of AR may be questionable, the study identified a subset of AR-positive triple-negative patients as being potential candidates for AR-directed therapy for which further studies are warranted.",breast_neoplasms

This study investigated glucose sensing and mediation, which are responsible for the high motility of MCF-7 cells. We evaluated the migration of MCF-7 cells cultured in high glucose-containing medium and essential regulatory factors from the perspective of the glucose transport system. We demonstrated that glucose transporter 12 (GLUT12) protein level increased in MCF-7 cells and co-localized with actin organization under high glucose conditions. Moreover, GLUT12-knockdown completely abrogated high glucose-induced migration, indicating that GLUT12 functionally participates in sensing high glucose concentrations.

Therefore, a combinatorial treatment approach with silibinin and rhTRAIL was considered in order to sensitize rhTRAIL-resistant TNBCs. The co-treatment of rhTRAIL and silibinin's impact on apoptosis induction in rhTRAIL-resistant TNBC BT-20 and HCC1937 cells was inspected via application of Annexin V/PI assays and western blot analysis. Silibinin possessed the ability to sensitize the examined rhTRAIL-resistant TNBC cells to rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis through the up-regulation of death receptors 4 and 5 and the down-regulation of survivin transcriptionally.

Isolated cells were characterized for CD90 and CD45 by immunocytochemistry. Pretreatment and conjugation therapies of vitamin E in 50mM and 100mM concentration were used on WJMSCs and breast cancer plasma was provided to mimic the cancer conditions, while WJMSCs provided with normal plasma were considered control. Cells' viability, proliferation and death were evaluated by crystal violet staining, MTT assay and LDH assay, respectively. Oxidative stress was observed by activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (GSH, catalase, SOD) and reactive oxygen species (MDA). The isolated cells expressed mesenchymal stem cells marker CD90 and lacked hematopoietic marker CD45. Vitamin E improved the viability and proliferation of WJMSCs in normal plasma, in conjugation with breast cancer plasma and in pretreatment groups but conjugation group showed even better results with concentration of 100mM as compared to the pretreatment group and opposite was observed for LDH assay for cells death analysis. Vitamin E also reduced the oxidative stress in 100mM more pronounced in conjugation group as compared to pretreatment group while left no harmful effects on WJMSCs in normal plasma. Vitamin E conjugation with breast cancer conditions significantly improved growth of WJMSCs. Thus vitamin E treated WJMSCs are better therapeutic options for breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Charts for patients with stage I-II endometrial carcinoma who underwent operation without postoperative therapy between January 2005 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed and the baseline risk of recurrence and prognosis were assessed. Risk classifications were performed according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines and Japanese guideline written by Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology Group. Among 374 patients who underwent complete resection, 311 were evaluable. Five-year recurrence rates by ESMO and Japanese were 2.6% and 3.1% in low-risk, 9.2% and 6.6% in intermediate-risk and 13.5% and 13.8% in high-risk group (p=0.003 and 0.015, respectively).

This study aims to identify risk factors of positive margins and locoregional recurrence. 437 patients who underwent a lumpectomy for invasive breast carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ have been included. Age, surgical margins, size, type, grade and number of tumor foci, the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ, lymph node status, expression of hormone receptors and HER-2 gene were assessed as risk factors for positive margins and locoregional recurrence. The disease-free survival is 94 % at 10 years. Patients with positive margins have lower survival (92 %) than those with negative margins (96 %) (p ? 0.05). Lobular and multifocal tumors are at risk of positive margins. Tumors with positive margins, T2, grade III, triple negative and HER-2 positive neoplasms are at risk of locoregional recurrence while the expression of hormone receptors is a protective factor for local recurrence. It appears in our study that invasive lobular and multifocal tumors may present positive surgical margins. Studies on pre- operative work-up are needed.

29176408,"Cancer patients may be particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of prolonged opioid use. The authors explored the factors that influence postoperative opioid prescription fills among women following postmastectomy reconstruction. Using the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases, the authors identified a cohort of 4113 opioid-naive patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction between January of 2010 and August of 2014. Outcomes included average daily oral morphine equivalents and the incidence of prolonged opioid fills (between 90 and 120 days after surgery). Using multivariable regression, the authors examined the effect of patient demographic characteristics, reconstructive technique, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, and postoperative complications on outcome variables. In this cohort, 90 percent of patients filled opioid prescriptions perioperatively, and 10 percent continued to fill prescriptions beyond 3 months after surgery. Patients with depression were more likely to fill prescriptions of higher average daily oral morphine equivalents (74.2 mg versus 58.3 mg; p < 0.01), and patients with anxiety were more likely to fill opioids for prolonged periods (13.4 percent versus 9.1 percent; p < 0.01). Patients undergoing autologous free flap reconstruction were less likely to fill prescriptions for a prolonged period following surgery (5.9 percent versus 10.2 percent; p < 0.001). Prescription opioid fills are common following breast reconstruction, and 10 percent of all patients continue to fill opioid prescriptions beyond 3 months after surgery. Prolonged fills are influenced by both patient factors and surgical procedure, and attention should be directed toward identifying opioid alternatives when possible. Risk, III.",breast_neoplasms
29176314,"Zinc finger protein 703 (ZNF703), initially identified as a novel oncogene in human breast cancer, is a member of the NET/NlZ family of zinc finger transcription factors. It is recognized that the overexpression of ZNF703 is associated with various types of human cancers, but the role and molecular mechanism of ZNF703 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are unknown. ZNF703 expression levels were examined in OSCC tissues and non-cancerous tissues by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The molecular mechanisms of ZNF703 and its effects on cell growth and metastasis were explored in vitro and in vivo using the CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, migration and invasion assays, wound-healing assay, western blotting and xenograft experiments in nude mice. In this study, ZNF703 was found to be upregulated in OSCC tissues compared to that in normal tissues at both mRNA and protein levels, and its expression level was closely correlated with the overall survival of patients with OSCC. Silencing of the ZNF703 gene in OSCC cells significantly inhibited cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, the overexpression of ZNF703 in OSCC cells promoted cancer growth and metastasis in vitro. Mechanistically, ZNF703 activated the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3?? signalling pathway and its downstream effectors, thus regulating the cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, the promotive effects of ZNF703 on cellular proliferation and metastasis could be rescued by LY294002 (a PI3K-specific inhibitor) and MK2206 (an Akt-specific inhibitor). The results show that ZNF703 promotes cell growth and metastasis through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3?? signalling in OSCC and that it may be a promising target in the treatment of patients with OSCC.",breast_neoplasms

29172851,"The study of the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer has revealed differences among them in terms of prognosis and response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. However, the ability of intrinsic subtypes to predict benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy has only been examined in few studies. Gene expression-based intrinsic subtyping was performed in 228 breast tumors collected from two independent post-mastectomy clinical trials (British Columbia and the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82b trials), where pre-menopausal patients with node-positive disease were randomized to adjuvant radiotherapy or not. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and a subgroup of patients underwent ovarian ablation. Tumors were classified into intrinsic subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like and Normal-like using the research-based PAM50 classifier. In the British Columbia study, patients treated with radiation had an overall significant lower incidence of locoregional recurrence compared to the controls. For Luminal A tumors the risk of loco-regional recurrence was low and was further lowered by adjuvant radiation. These findings were validated in the DBCG 82b study. The individual data from the two cohorts were merged, the hazard ratio (HR) for loco-regional recurrence associated with giving radiation was 0.34 (0.19 to 0.61) overall and 0.12 (0.03 to 0.52) for Luminal A tumors. In both postmastectomy trials, patients with Luminal A tumors turned out to have a significant lower incidence of loco-regional recurrence when randomized to adjuvant radiotherapy, leaving no indication to omit postmastectomy adjuvant radiation in pre-menopausal high-risk patients with Luminal A tumors.

29169152,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a high-risk breast cancer phenotype without specific targeted therapy options and is significantly associated with increased local recurrence in patients treated with radiotherapy. CAVEOLIN-1 (CAV-1)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) nuclear translocation following irradiation promotes DNA repair and thus induces radiation resistance. In this study, we aimed to determine whether knockdown of CAV-1 enhances the radiosensitivity of basal-like TNBC cell lines and to explore the possible mechanisms. Western blotting was used to compare protein expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Nuclear accumulation of EGFR as well as DNA repair and damage at multiple time points following irradiation with or without CAV-1 siRNA pretreatment were investigated using western blotting and confocal microscopy. The radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA was evaluated using a clonogenic assay. Flowcytometry was performed to analyse cell apoptosis and cell cycle alteration. We found that CAV-1 is over-expressed in basal-like TNBC cell lines and barely expressed in HER-2-positive cells; additionally, we observed that HER-2-positive cell lines are more sensitive to irradiation than basal-like TNBC cells. Our findings revealed that radiation-induced EGFR nuclear translocation was impaired by knockdown of CAV-1. In parallel, radiation-induced elevation of DNA repair proteins was also hampered by pretreatment with CAV-1 siRNA before irradiation. Silencing of CAV-1 also promoted DNA damage 24 h after irradiation. Colony formation assays verified that cells could be radiosensitized after knockdown of CAV-1. Furthermore, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis enhancement may also contribute to the radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA. Our results support the hypothesis that CAV-1 knockdown by siRNA causes increased radiosensitivity in basal-like TNBC cells. The mechanisms associated with this effect are reduced DNA repair through delayed CAV-1-associated EGFR nuclear accumulation and induction of G2/M arrest and apoptosis through the combined effects of CAV-1 siRNA and radiation.",breast_neoplasms

In order to demonstrate this occurrence, long-term follow-up studies are necessary. From several national registries in Denmark, it is possible to link data from different sources and analyze this issue. A study cohort of 68,842 breast cancer patients prospectively diagnosed and registered in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group's database during the period 1995-2012 formed the basis of the analysis. These data were matched with data on all types of fractures from the Danish National Patient Register and vital data from the Danish Civil Registration System. After data cleaning 66,502 patients were available for analysis and 16,360 of these had incurred 20,341 fractures with 13,182 patients having just one fracture. These fractures were distributed over 214 specific fracture sites. An extended multivariable Cox regression model revealed significant association between the occurrence of fractures and age, menopause, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and endocrine therapy such that late menopause and tamoxifen treatment were associated with a lower occurrence and AI treatment, age and CCI were associated with a higher occurrence of fractures.

29168428,"In breast cancer, there is a growing body of evidence that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may have clinical utility and may be able to direct clinical decisions for subgroups of patients. Clinical utility is, however, not sufficient for warranting the implementation of a new biomarker in the routine practice, and evaluation of the analytical validity is needed, including testing the reproducibility of decentralized assessment of TILs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-observer agreement of TILs assessment using a standardized method, as proposed by the International TILs Working Group 2014, applied to a cohort of breast cancers reflecting an average breast cancer population. Stromal TILs were assessed using full slide sections from 124 breast cancers with varying histology, malignancy grade and ER- and HER2 status. TILs were estimated by nine dedicated breast pathologists using scanned hematoxylin-eosin stainings. TILs results were categorized using various cutoffs, and the inter-observer agreement was evaluated using the intraclass coefficient (ICC), Kappa statistics as well as individual overall agreements with the median value of TILs. Evaluation of TILs led to an ICC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.77) corresponding to an acceptable agreement. Kappa values were in the range of 0.38-0.46 corresponding to a fair to moderate agreement. The individual agreements increased, when using only two categories ('high' vs. 'low' TILs) and a cutoff of 50-60%. The results of the present study are in accordance with previous studies, and shows that the proposed methodology for standardized evaluation of TILs renders an acceptable inter-observer agreement. The findings, however, indicate that assessment of TILs needs further refinement, and is in support of the latest St. Gallen Consensus, that routine reporting of TILs for early breast cancer is not ready for implementation in a clinical setting.",breast_neoplasms

Disruption of the pectoralis major origin and the frequent occurrence of animation deformity and functional discomfort associated with subpectoral reconstruction remain ongoing concerns. Prepectoral single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction resolves many of these issues. In this study, the authors explored the rationale for prepectoral single-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with anterior AlloDerm coverage as an alternative to the staged approach. Seventy-three breasts in 50 patients were reconstructed using a single-stage direct-to-implant prepectoral approach with total anterior AlloDerm coverage during a 24-month period. The decision to proceed with single-stage reconstruction was predicated upon the adequacy of mastectomy skin flap blood flow based on indocyanine green fluorescence perfusion assessment. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 32 months. Ninety-seven percent of patients achieved complete healing within 8 weeks. There were 2 implant losses (2.7%) due to infection. Major seroma rate requiring repeated aspiration and drain insertion was 1.2%. There were no full-thickness skin losses. Capsular contracture was 0% in nonradiated patients. There were no cases of animation deformity. The authors were unable to establish significant correlation between complications and any of the usually stated risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and large mastectomy weights, presumably due to the rigorous application of intraoperative skin perfusion assessment.

We aimed to estimate overall- (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) according to tumor characteristics and treatment among women who within two years of definitive surgery for primary BC were shown to carry a mutation in BRCA1/2 . From the clinical database of the Danish Breast Cancer Group we included 141 BRCA1 and 96 BRCA2 BC patients. Estrogen receptor and HER2 status were centrally reviewed on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Information on risk reducing surgery was obtained from the Danish Pathology and Patient Registries and included as time-dependent variables in Cox proportional hazard models. Ten-year OS and DFS for BRCA1 BC patients were 78% (95% CI?69-85) and 74% (95% CI 64-81). Ten-year OS and DFS for BRCA2 BC were 88% (95% CI?78-94) and 84% (95% CI?74-91).

29164968,"Transcriptome analysis enables classification of breast tumors into molecular subtypes. BRCA1/2 predisposed patients are more likely to suffer from a basal-like subtype and this group of patients displays a more distinct phenotype and genotype. Hence, in-depth characterization of this separate entity is needed. Molecular subtyping was performed on a consecutive and unselected series of 1560 tumors from patients with primary breast cancer. Tumors were classified by the 256 gene expression signature (CIT) and associated with basic clinical characteristics and aggregated expression levels in the hallmark gene sets. Of the 1560 samples, 168 were classified basal-like and 120 patients were screened for BRCA1/2 mutations, resulting in 19 BRCA1/2 carriers, 95 non-carriers and six patients carried variants of unknown significance. The BRCA1/2 carriers were significantly younger and there were no carriers above 60 years of age. The tumors showed a loss in DNA-repair profile, as well as an upregulation in proliferative cancer signaling pathways. A robust molecular signature for identification of the BRCA1/2 - carriers was infeasible in the current cohort. Patients with a basal like breast cancer had the lowest median age and the largest median tumor size. They were almost exclusively diagnosed in disease stage III. Basal-like subtype is indeed a separate entity compared with other molecular breast cancer subtypes and the clinical course for this patient group should reflect the aggressiveness of this cancer.

29157215,"Nowadays, many public repositories containing large microarray gene expression datasets are available. However, the problem lies in the fact that microarray technology are less powerful and accurate than more recent Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq. In any case, information from microarrays is truthful and robust, thus it can be exploited through the integration of microarray data with RNA-Seq data. Additionally, information extraction and acquisition of large number of samples in RNA-Seq still entails very high costs in terms of time and computational resources.This paper proposes a new model to find the gene signature of breast cancer cell lines through the integration of heterogeneous data from different breast cancer datasets, obtained from microarray and RNA-Seq technologies. Consequently, data integration is expected to provide a more robust statistical significance to the results obtained. Finally, a classification method is proposed in order to test the robustness of the Differentially Expressed Genes when unseen data is presented for diagnosis. The proposed data integration allows analyzing gene expression samples coming from different technologies. The most significant genes of the whole integrated data were obtained through the intersection of the three gene sets, corresponding to the identified expressed genes within the microarray data itself, within the RNA-Seq data itself, and within the integrated data from both technologies. This intersection reveals 98 possible technology-independent biomarkers. Two different heterogeneous datasets were distinguished for the classification tasks: a training dataset for gene expression identification and classifier validation, and a test dataset with unseen data for testing the classifier. Both of them achieved great classification accuracies, therefore confirming the validity of the obtained set of genes as possible biomarkers for breast cancer. Through a feature selection process, a final small subset made up by six genes was considered for breast cancer diagnosis. This work proposes a novel data integration stage in the traditional gene expression analysis pipeline through the combination of heterogeneous data from microarrays and RNA-Seq technologies.

29145336,"Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) is a rare subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma which is generally recognized as a characteristic subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers previously. However, in this study, we reported for the first time a case of LGASC with hormone receptors expression. Pathological analysis of breast tumor specimen obtained by a 42-year-old female patient was performed. Morphologically, it composed of glandular structures with scattered squamous differentiation accompanied by haphazard arrangement of spindle cell stroma. Immunohistochemically, all myoepithelial and squamous differentiation markers showed typical LGASC positive or negative staining pattern. Interestingly, we found that normally aberrant hormone receptors were reactivated in this case. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hormone receptor-positive LGASC. Apart from this, in the extended resection sample, we found scattered squamous metaplasia and florid adenosquamous proliferation (ASP). Meanwhile, it was positive for CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v), which is a breast cancer stem cell (CSC) marker, and expressed in LGASC, squamous metaplasia, and ASP. LGASC with hormone receptors expression. The breast-extended local excision and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. The patient was free of local recurrence and distant metastasis 6 months after surgical resection. We herein report the first case of LGASC with immunoreactivity for hormone receptors, expanding its profile of immunophenotypes. CD44v may play an important role in the transition of LGASC precursor lesions into malignant processes, which may serve as a therapeutic target in LGASC.",breast_neoplasms

Nevertheless, its prognostic value in breast cancer tumor is yet contentious. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic significance of PKM2 in breast cancer. Eligible relevant literatures were retrieved by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase through December 2016. Articles that comparing different PKM2 expression levels in human breast cancer tissues and prognostic significance were included. Software RevMan 5.3 and STATA (Review Manager (RevMan): [Computer program]. Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014. StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) were applied to analyze the outcomes. Pooled results were presented in hazardous ratios (HRs) of 5-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios (ORs) of clinicopathological features with 95% confidence intervals. Data from 6 involved studies with 895 patients were summarized. Breast cancer patients with high PKM2 had a worse OS (pooled HR?=?1.65, 95% CI?=?1.31-2.08, P?<?.001) and PFS (pooled HR?=?2.49, 95% CI?=?1.84-3.36, P?<?.00001). High PKM2 expression is related to lymph node metastasis (N1+N2+N3 vs N0, OR?=?1.97, 95%CI?=?1.39-2.80, P?=?.0001). The outcome stability was verified via sensitivity analysis. But elevated PKM2 expression was not correlated to tumor stage (T2+T3 vs T1, pooled OR?=?0.80, 95% CI?=?0.36-1.77, P?=?.58) and differential grade (G2+G3 vs G1, OR?=?2.74, 95%CI?=?0.76-9.84, P?=?.12). No publication bias was found in the included studies for OS (Begg test, P?=?.260; Egger test, P?=?.747). High PKM2 expression denotes worse OS and PFS in breast cancer patients, and correlate with the lymph node metastasis. However, there is no evidence for the impact of PKM2 expression on T stage and tumor differentiation.",breast_neoplasms

Herein, we reported 3 Chinese patients with BCP who underwent chemotherapy during pregnancy and were followed up for adverse effects. Three female patients (case 1, case 2, and case 3) of 37-, 32-, and 28-year-old with breast masses were enrolled. Case 1 had been pregnant for over 4 months, case 2 over 7 months, and case 3 for 7 months. Ultrasound findings revealed a mass in the left breast in cases 1 and 2 (30?mm????26?mm????23?mm and 34?mm????16?mm????40?mm), and case 3 had 2 masses in the outer upper quadrant of right breast (27?mm????27?mm????26?mm, 18?mm????17?mm????17?mm) and 2 fixed enlarged lymph nodes in the right axillary fossa, respectively.

The most common adverse reactions of CAP primarily included gastrointestinal and dermatological effects. Whereas, the CAP-induced fatty liver had never been reported. In this study, a-69-year old female presented a history of hypertension with regulated blood pressure, whereas diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hepatitis were excluded. No alcohol,tobacco, or other drugs use was declared. She was diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinoma of left breast with the hepatic and pulmonary metastasis. The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is not involved. She received treatment with CAP that was administered orally at a dosage of 1500mg twice daily intermittently (2weeks on/1 week off). The treatment was well-tolerated any typical adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) were noted. The parameters of the functional liver, the total cholesterol, and triglyceride were in normal ranges before and after therapy. After 3 cycles of the treatment, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed signs of fatty liver. After a 10-cycle course, CAP was substituted with tamoxifen because of the further aggravation of fatty liver. Several months after withdrawal, the follow-up CT scans demonstrated significant improvement of fatty liver. We presented a case of breast cancer with severe fatty liver as a consequence of the administration of CAP that was not involved in DPD deficiency or CAP-associated hypertriglyceridemia; these potential adverse effects of therapy with CAP should be intensely investigated.",breast_neoplasms

Patients with HER2-negative and endocrine treatment-resistant breast cancer with metastasis or recurrence after surgery were randomly assigned to receive first-line taxane or S-1. PROs (secondary endpoint) were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. We conducted a responder analysis for the QLQ-C30 and PNQ and created cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots as a sensitivity analysis. The questionnaire response rates were over 80% from 386 patients, who completed at least one baseline questionnaire. S-1 was significantly superior to taxane with respect to 6 scales (physical functioning [p = 0.03], role functioning [p = 0.04], social functioning [p < 0.01], financial difficulties [p = 0.01], global health status [p = 0.02], and constipation [p < 0.01]) and sensory neuropathy (p = 0.01).

The aim of this study was to chart the diagnostic pathway for the five most common cancers in the Netherlands. A retrospective cohort study using cancer patients' anonymised primary care data (free text and coded) linked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We determined the median duration of the following: 1. Primary care intervals (IPCs): the first cancer-related general practitioner consultation to referral, 2. Referral intervals (IRs): referral to diagnosis, 3. Treatment intervals (ITs): diagnosis to treatment?and the overarching intervals, 4. Diagnostic intervals (IDs): IPC and IR combined and 5. Health care intervals (IHCs): IPC, IR and IT combined. For 465, 309, 197, 237 and 149 patients diagnosed with breast-, colorectal-, lung-, prostate cancer and melanoma, respectively; median IPC, IR and ID durations were shortest for breast cancer and melanoma (ID duration 7 and 21 days, respectively), intermediate for lung- and colon cancer (ID duration 49 and 54 days) and the longest for prostate cancer (ID duration 137 days). For all cancers, the duration of intervals increased steeply for the 10-25% with longest durations. For colorectal cancer, increasing ID durations showed increasing proportions of time attributable to primary care (IPC). Approximately 10-25% of cancer patients show?substantially long duration of diagnostic intervals. Reducing primary care delay seems particularly relevant for colorectal cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29143928,"A major treatment goal for advanced breast cancer (ABC) is to maintain or ideally improve patient quality of life (QoL). Given the changing disease landscape, this systematic literature review (SLR) aims to assess the impact of endocrine therapies (ET), including ET monotherapy (ET mono) and ET combined with targeted therapy (ET?+?TT), on QoL of women with HR+/HER2- ABC. A SLR was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the following criteria: (1) included ET mono or ET?+?TT, (2) reported QoL outcomes, (3) focused on women with HR+/HER2- ABC, and (4) published after 2007 (when standardized HER2 testing became available). The databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and key conference proceedings from 2013 to 2016. QoL outcomes for ET mono, ET?+?TT, and comparisons between the two were summarized from the identified trials. A total of 11 studies (representing 6 RCTs) were identified. The study populations included first-line (5 studies) and ET-failure settings (6 studies). Across settings, global health status (GHS) maintained or deteriorated slightly on these treatments during the trial period. Time to deterioration (TTD) in QoL measured by GHS was analyzed in 6 studies and 4 RCTs. In the first-line setting, reported median TTD in GHS was similar between ET mono and ET?+?TT (7.2-13.8?months in ET mono; 11.1?months in ET?+?TT). In the ET-failure setting, ET?+?TT showed significantly longer TTD vs. ET mono in GHS (median 5.6-8.4?months in ET mono and 8.3-11.7?months in ET?+?TT) and some additional domains. ET?+?TT users experienced similar QoL in the first-line and ET-failure setting relative to patients on ET mono.

29141543,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women in both developed and Third World countries. Fucoidan is a natural plant metabolite produced by brown seaweeds with proven anticancer potential. This study determined the cytotoxic, apoptotic and cell cycle effects of fucoidan alone and in combination with first-line anticancer drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and non-malignant MCF-12A breast epithelial cells as control. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT reduction assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin VFITC/PI and Hoechst 33342 staining, and caspases-3, -7 and -9 activation. Fucoidan alone was significantly more cytotoxic to MCF-7 breast cancer cells compared to the MCF-12A non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line. In MCF-7 cells, the presence of fucoidan caused cell cycle arrest at G1 with accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase with the activation of caspases-3,-7 and -9. Furthermore, combination of fucoidan with the standard chemotherapeutic agents-cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol-significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of these drugs and accumulation of cells in the G2/M and sub-G1 phases, and induction of apoptosis. No significant differences were observed between fucoidan-treated and untreated MCF-12A cells with respect to cytotoxicity and cell cycle distribution profiles. By contrast, in non-cancerous MCF-12A cells, fucoidan attenuated the toxicity of doxorubicin and cisplatin in combination by increasing their IC50 values. This effect was not demonstrated with the taxol combination. Fucoidan is an effective antitumor agent, either alone or in combination with cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Drug combinations that discriminate between cancerous and non-cancerous cells afford a plausible and viable strategy of attaining therapeutic efficacy and avoiding possible toxicity and side effects. These findings suggest that fucoidan is a promising candidate for cancer combination therapies.",breast_neoplasms
29137596,"Gene expression profiling has led to the definition of breast cancer molecular subtypes: Basal-like, HER2-enriched, LuminalA, LuminalB and Normal-like. Different subtypes exhibit diverse responses to treatment. In the past years, several traditional clustering algorithms have been applied to analyze gene expression profiling. However, accurate identification of breast cancer subtypes, especially within highly variable LuminalA subtype, remains a challenge. Furthermore, the relationship between DNA methylation and expression level in different breast cancer subtypes is not clear. In this study, a modified ISA biclustering algorithm, termed AP-ISA, was proposed to identify breast cancer subtypes. Comparing with ISA, AP-ISA provides the optimized strategy to select seeds and thresholds in the circumstance that prior knowledge is absent. Experimental results on 574 breast cancer samples were evaluated using clinical ER/PR information, PAM50 subtypes and the results of five peer to peer methods. One remarkable point in the experiment is that, AP-ISA divided the expression profiles of the luminal samples into four distinct classes. Enrichment analysis and methylation analysis showed obvious distinction among the four subgroups. Tumor variability within the Luminal subtype is observed in the experiments, which could contribute to the development of novel directed therapies. Aiming at breast cancer subtype classification, a novel biclustering algorithm AP-ISA is proposed in this paper. AP-ISA classifies breast cancer into seven subtypes and we argue that there are four subtypes in luminal samples. Comparison with other methods validates the effectiveness of AP-ISA. New genes that would be useful for targeted treatment of breast cancer were also obtained in this study.",breast_neoplasms
29137038,"Axillary lymph node metastasis is associated with increased risk of regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and poor survival in breast malignant neoplasm. Expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is significantly associated with tumor formation, migration, and invasion in various cancers. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression could promote angiogenesis and increase the risk of tumorigenesis. To determine correlations among STAT3 expression, VEGF, and clinicopathological data on lymph node involvement in breast cancer patients after surgery. The mRNA expression levels of STAT3 and VEGFs were measured in 45 breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissues, 45 peritumoral tissues, and 45 adjacent nontumor tissues by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Postoperative pathological examination revealed explicit axillary lymph node involvement in all patients. Average mRNA levels of STAT3 and VEGFs were the highest in breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissues, followed by peritumoral tissues. High expression of STAT3 showed significant positive correlation with high axillary lymph node involvement and progesterone receptor (PR), VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3 expression. The expression levels of STAT3, VEGF-C, and VEGFR-3 were significantly higher in the tumor tissues of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis than in those of patients without the metastasis. Expression levels of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were also significantly higher in peritumoral tissues of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis. Positive correlations were found between STAT3 and VEGF-C/-D mRNA levels. These data suggest that STAT3/VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis and lymph-angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that STAT3 may be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting the involvement of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer, and therapies targeting STAT3 may be important for preventing breast cancer metastasis.",breast_neoplasms

As a parameter that can reflect inflammation and host immune reaction, elevated blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been confirmed to be correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. However, this remains controversial in breast cancer. Thus, we performed this updated meta-analysis to further clarify whether high NLR could be a predictor of survival in breast cancer patients. We searched on PubMed Database and Cochrane Library. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival were used as outcome events, and hazard ratio (HR) was chosen as the parameter to evaluate the correlation. Eighteen eligible studies were involved in this meta-analysis. The synthesized analysis demonstrated that elevated NLR was associated with poor DFS [HR?=?1.72, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)?=?1.30-2.27], OS (HR?=?1.87, 95% CI?=?1.41-2.48), and cancer-specific survival (HR?=?2.09, 95% CI?=?1.04-4.21). The correlation was stronger in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (OS: HR?=?2.58, 95% CI?=?1.63-4.06; DFS: HR?=?3.51, 95% CI?=?1.97-6.24).

Little is known about how well electronic health record-based algorithms can identify dates or how errors in dates can bias analyses. We assessed rule-based and model-fitting approaches to assign event dates using a previously published electronic health record-based algorithm for second breast cancer events (SBCE). We conducted a simulation study to assess bias due to date assignment errors in time-to-event analyses. From a cohort of 3152 early-stage breast cancer patients, 358 women accurately identified as having had an SBCE served as the basis for this analysis. Percent of predicted SBCE dates identified within ??60 days of the true date was the primary measure of accuracy. In the simulation study, bias in hazard ratios (HRs) was estimated by averaging the difference between HRs based on algorithm-assigned dates and the true HR across 1000 simulations each with simulated N=4000.

29131020,"Reports regarding the role of androgen in breast cancer (BC) are conflicting. Some studies suggest that androgen could lead to undesirable responses in the presence of certain BC tumor characteristics. We have shown that androgen induces C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) in BC cell lines. Our aim was to identify the mechanisms regulating the phenotypic effects of androgen-induced CXCL12 on Androgen Receptor (AR) positive BC cell lines. We analyzed the expression of CXCL12 and its receptors with qPCR and ELISA and the role of Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1 (NCOA1) in this effect. AR effects on the CXCL12 promoter was studied via Chromatin-immunoprecipitation. We also analyzed publically available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to verify AR-CXCL12 interactions and to identify the effect or Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) therapy on CXCL12 expression and disease progression in AR positive cases. CXCL12 induction occurs only in AR-positive BC cell lines, possibly via an Androgen Response Element, upstream of the CXCL12 promoter. The steroid receptor co-regulator NCOA1 is critical for this effect. Androgen only induced the motility of p53-mutant BC cells T47D cells via upregulation of CXCR4 expression while they had no effect on wild-type p53 MCF-7 cells. Loss of CXCR4 expression and depletion of CXCL12 abolished the effect of androgen in T47D cells while inhibition of p53 expression in MCF-7 cells made them responsive to androgen and increased their motility in the presence to androgen. Patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/AR+ BC treated with AIs were at increased risk of disease progression compared to ER+/AR+ non-AI treated and ER+/AR- AI treated cases. AIs may lead to unfavorable responses in some ER/AR positive BC cases, especially in patients with AR+, p53 mutant tumors.",breast_neoplasms

29122005,"Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment represent stressful events that demand emotional adjustment, thus recruiting coping strategies and defense mechanisms. As parental relations were shown to influence emotion regulation patterns and adaptive processes in adulthood, the present study investigated whether they are specifically associated to coping and defense mechanisms in patients with breast cancer. One hundred and ten women hospitalized for breast cancer surgery were administered questionnaires assessing coping with cancer, defense mechanisms, and memories of parental bonding in childhood. High levels of paternal overprotection were associated with less mature defenses, withdrawal and fantasy and less adaptive coping mechanisms, such as hopelessness/helplessness. Low levels of paternal care were associated with a greater use of repression. No association was found between maternal care, overprotection, coping and defense mechanisms. Immature defenses correlated positively with less adaptive coping styles, while mature defenses were positively associated to a fighting spirit and to fatalism, and inversely related to less adaptive coping styles. These data suggest that paternal relations in childhood are associated with emotional, cognitive, and behavioral regulation in adjusting to cancer immediately after surgery.

Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. A total of 82 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 or younger (24.8%). Median age was 36?years. More than one quarter (26%) of patients had family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Advanced stages accounted for 34.2% of cases. Median tumor diameter was 2.8?cm. Intermediate and high-grade tumors represented 47.6% and 40.2%, respectively. Nodal involvement was present in 58.5% and lymphovascular invasion was found in 47.7% of the patients. About two thirds (66.2%) of tumors were hormone receptor positive, 29.2% over-expressed HER2 receptor and 23% were triple negative. Patients underwent breast conserving surgery in 38.2% of cases, 61.7% were offered adjuvant chemotherapy and 84.6% received hormone therapy. Five-year DFS and OS were respectively 88.9% and 75.6%. Locoregional recurrence occurred in 2.8% of cases and 8.3% of patients developed distant metastases. Our findings are in accordance with previous studies that have shown a higher frequency of breast cancer among Moroccan young women. In line with literature data, clinicopathologic profile seems to be aggressive and prognosis is pejorative in our series.",breast_neoplasms
29120835,"Mass breast cancer screening is offered to French women between the ages of 50 and 74. In the French overseas department of Guadeloupe, where the population is of mostly African ancestry, a low age at diagnosis of breast cancer has been reported, as for African-Americans. This raises the question of whether breast cancer is more aggressive in the age group preceding that eligible for mass screening (40-49) in Guadeloupe. We compared the tumor-related prognostic factors, first line therapy and overall survival rates of breast cancer cases diagnosed between the 40-49 and 50-74 age groups, based on reports of the cancer registry of Guadeloupe for the period 2008-2013. The characteristics studied, risk of death after breast cancer (HR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.58-1.22] and overall survival, did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for higher tumor size (28.8 vs 24.0; p=0.004) in the younger group. These results do not show a pattern of more aggressive breast cancer in the age group preceding that eligible for mass screening in Guadeloupe.",breast_neoplasms
29120829,"Chamorro Pacific Islanders in the Mariana Islands have breast cancer incidence rates similar to, but mortality rates higher than, those of U.S. women. As breast cancer risk factors of women of the Mariana Islands may be unique because of ethnic and cultural differences, we studied established and suspected risk factors for breast cancer in this unstudied population. From 2010-2013, we conducted retrospective case-control study of female breast cancer (104 cases and 185 controls) among women in the Mariana Islands. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each of various lifestyle-related factors from logistic regression of breast cancer, in all women and in pre- and postmenopausal women separately. Tests for interaction of risk factors with ethnicity were based on the Wald statistics for cross-product terms. Of the medical and reproductive factors considered - age at menarche, breastfeeding, number of live births, age at first live birth, hormone use, and menopause - only age at first live birth was confirmed. Age at first live birth, among parous women, was higher among cases (mean 24.9 years) than controls (mean 23.2 years); with increased breast cancer risk (OR=2.53; 95% CI, 1.04-6.19 for age??30y compared to <20y, P for trend=0.01). Of the lifestyle factors -body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, alcohol and betel-nut intake, and education - only waist circumference (OR=1.65; 95% CI 0.87-3.14 for the highest tertile group compared to the lowest, P for trend=0.04) was significantly associated with breast cancer risk and only in Filipino women. The association with many other established risk factors, such as BMI, hormone use and physical activity, were in the expected direction but were not significant. Associations for family history of breast cancer and alcohol intake were not evident CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a basis for cancer prevention guidance for women in the Mariana Islands.",breast_neoplasms
29120823,"The Solomon Islands, with a population of 550,000, has significant challenges in addressing non-communicable diseases, including cancer, in the face of significant economic, cultural, general awareness and health system challenges. To summarise the existing knowledge regarding cancer in the Solomon Islands, to gather new data and make recommendations. A literature review was undertaken and cancer data from the National Referral Hospital, Honiara were analysed and are presented. Key stakeholders were interviewed for their perspectives including areas to target for ongoing, incremental improvements. Last, a health services audit for cancer using the WHO SARA tool was undertaken. Breast and cervical cancer remain the first and second most commonly identified cancers in the Solomon Islands. The Solomons cancer registry is hospital based and suffers from incomplete data collection due to its passive nature, lack of resources for data entry and processing resulting in weak data which is rarely used for decision-making. The health system audit revealed system and individual reasons for delayed diagnosis or lack of cancer treatment or palliation in the Solomon Islands. Reasons included lack of patient knowledge regarding symptoms, late referrals to the National Referral Hospital and inability of health care workers to detect cancers either due to lack of skills to do so, or lack of diagnostic capabilities, and an overall lack of access to any health care, due to geographical barriers and overall national economic fragility. The Solomon Islands is challenged in preventing, diagnosing, treating and palliating cancer. Stakeholders recommend establishing specialty expertise (in the form of a cancer unit), improved registry processes and increased collaboration between the sole tertiary hospital nationwide and other Solomon health services as important targets for incremental improvement.",breast_neoplasms
29117576,"Chemotherapy results in permanent loss of ovarian function in some premenopausal women. Accurate identification in women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer (eBC) would allow optimisation of subsequent endocrine treatment. We sought to assess whether analysis of anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) using a sensitive automated assay could identify women who would not regain ovarian function after chemotherapy. Data from women in the Ovarian Protection Trial in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients (OPTION) trial of goserelin (a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue) for ovarian protection were analysed. Women were assessed for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI: amenorrhoea with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) at 24 months after diagnosis. The accuracy of AMH for the diagnosis of POI and its prediction from measurement at the end of chemotherapy was calculated. AMH below the level of detection showed good diagnostic accuracy for POI at 24 months (n?=?73) with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve of 0.86, sensitivity 1.0 and specificity 0.73 at the assay limit of detection. In women aged >40?at diagnosis who did not receive goserelin, AMH measured at end of chemotherapy also gave good prediction of POI at 24 months (area under the curve (AUC) 0.89 95% CI 0.75-1.0, n?=?32), with sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 42.8. FSH gave slightly lower AUC, and specificity was low at 0.55. Age but not tamoxifen impacted on AMH levels. Using this sensitive AMH assay, the finding of an undetectable AMH level in women aged >40?at the end of chemotherapy for eBC gave a good prediction that ovarian function would not return. This may allow alterations in post-chemotherapy endocrine management.",breast_neoplasms
29117353,"Overdiagnosis is the main harm of cancer screening programs but is difficult to quantify. This review aims to evaluate existing approaches to estimate the magnitude of overdiagnosis in cancer screening in order to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of these approaches and to provide researchers with guidance to obtain reliable estimates of overdiagnosis in cancer screening. A systematic review was done of primary research studies in PubMed that were published before January 1, 2016, and quantified overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening. The studies meeting inclusion criteria were then categorized by their methods to adjust for lead time and to obtain an unscreened reference population. For each approach, we provide an overview of the data required, assumptions made, limitations, and strengths. A total of 442 studies were identified in the initial search. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative review. We grouped the approaches to adjust for lead time in two main categories: the lead time approach and the excess incidence approach. The lead time approach was further subdivided into the mean lead time approach, lead time distribution approach, and natural history modeling. The excess incidence approach was subdivided into the cumulative incidence approach and early vs late-stage cancer approach. The approaches used to obtain an unscreened reference population were grouped into the following categories: control group of a randomized controlled trial, nonattenders, control region, extrapolation of a prescreening trend, uninvited groups, adjustment for the effect of screening, and natural history modeling. Each approach to adjust for lead time and obtain an unscreened reference population has its own strengths and limitations, which should be taken into consideration when estimating overdiagnosis.",breast_neoplasms
29116653,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is prone to metastasis and has a poor prognosis, with lower survival rates than other breast cancer subtypes. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as powerful regulators of cancer processes and become a promising target in cancer therapy. Expression of miR-128 was examined in invasive ductal breast cancer, and its relationship with clinicopathological features analysed. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the function and mechanism of miR-128 in the development of invasive ductal breast cancer. A cohort of 110 women with TNBC and 117 with non-TNBC were included in the study. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, overall and disease-free survival were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, histological grade and molecular subtype. Subgroup analysis showed that low expression of miR-128 correlated with shorter overall and disease-free survival in TNBC (P?<?0??001), and shorter overall but not disease-free survival in non-TNBC. In addition, miR-128 was able to inhibit glucose metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and proliferation of TNBC cells. These effects were consistent with miR-128 targeting inhibition of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1. MiR-128 might be a prognostic ",breast_neoplasms
29116313," Pancreatic metastases from primary malignant tumors at other sites are rare, constituting about 2% of the neoplasms that affect the pancreas. Pancreatic metastasis from breast cancer is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose, because its clinical and radiological presentation is similar to that of a primary pancreatic tumor. A 64-year-old female developed a lesion in the pancreatic tail 24 months after neoadjuvant therapy, surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy for right-side breast cancer (ductal carcinoma). She underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and left adrenalectomy, and presented an uneventful outcome. The immunohistochemical analysis on the surgical specimen suggested that the lesion originated from the breast. In cases of pancreatic lesions detected in patients with a previous history of breast neoplasm, the possibility of pancreatic metastasis should be carefully considered.",breast_neoplasms
29113903,"To evaluate role of surgery plus radiotherapy (RT) in patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression from breast cancer with a follow-up >10 years. The study included 23 patients treated between 2004 and 2008. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with good performance status, limited metastatic disease, and progressive neurologic deficit and/or intractable pain. RT was performed delivering a median total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the modified visual analog scale for pain, Frankel grade for neurologic deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatments and every 3 months thereafter. Minimal resection was performed in 17.4% of patients, curettage in 47.8%, and total tumorectomy in 34.8%, followed by RT in 78.3%. Pain remission was obtained in 98% of patients, and recovery of neurologic function was obtained in 92.9%. Median follow-up time was 153 months (range, 128-209 months). No relapse at site of treatments occurred. Median overall survival time was 47 months (95% confidence interval 33-114 months), and 2-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 81% (??8.6%), 42.9% (??10.8%), and 28.6% (??9.9%). On univariate analysis, performance status, type of surgical resection, breast cancer phenotype, and presence of other bone metastases were recorded as influencing survival; the last-mentioned was also confirmed in multivariate analysis. Surgery plus RT is a safe and feasible treatment with limited morbidity. In selected patients with good performance status, positive hormonal receptors, and limited metastatic disease, surgical intervention should be strongly considered early on.",breast_neoplasms
29112227,"High-level evidence is lacking to guide treatment decisions about postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in patients who have breast cancer with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes who receive contemporary systemic therapies, leading to potential variations in PMRT delivery. The objective of this study was to examine nationwide trends in PMRT use in this group. The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was used to identify 93,372 women who had T1-T2N1 breast cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2012. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) and those who had bilateral breast cancers were excluded. Time trends were evaluated using the Cochrane-Armitage test and correlated the receipt of PMRT with various patient demographic, facility, clinicopathologic, and treatment variables using multivariable logistic regression. A second analysis was performed for patients who were diagnosed during 2010 and included radiation oncologist density as an additional covariate. P values?<?.0001 were considered statistically significant. Overall, 22.5% of the study population received PMRT, representing an increase from 19.1% in 2003 to 30.3% in 2012. Factors associated with greater PMRT use included younger age, lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores, shorter distance to the treating facility, treatment at a comprehensive cancer program, facility location in the New England Census division, and higher density of radiation oncologists. Increased PMRT use was associated with later year of diagnosis, receipt of chemotherapy, receipt of hormone therapy, higher grade disease, larger tumor size, greater numbers of positive lymph nodes, positive margins, and absence of immediate breast reconstruction (all P?<?.0001). The receipt of PMRT by patients with breast cancer who have 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes has increased over time, with wide variability in practice patterns in the United States.

29108713,"Combining targeted agents and endocrine therapy (ET) improves outcomes in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients but increases the risk of adverse events (AEs). This meta-analysis aims to estimate the comparative risk of AEs with ET in addition to targeted agents in this setting. A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and conference proceedings up to July 17th 2017 was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials investigating ET with or without CDK4/6, mTOR, PI3K inhibitors and anti-HER2 agents. We calculated summary risk estimates (odds ratio, OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each AE within each class of targeted agents for each trial, and pooled analysis using the random and fixed effect models. Sixteen studies (n=8529 patients) were included. The addition of targeted agents to ET was associated with a significant higher risk of grade 3-4 AEs: OR 2.86 (95% CI 2.49-3.27) for CDK4/6 inhibitors, 1.88 (95% CI 1.39-2.53) for mTOR inhibitors, 2.05 (95% CI 1.63-2.58) for PI3K inhibitors, and 2.48 (95% CI 1.09-5.66) for anti-HER2 agents. The highest class-specific risks were neutropenia grade 3-4 for CDK4/6 inhibitors (OR 40.77; 95% CI 19.52-85.19), stomatitis grade 3-4 for mTOR inhibitors (OR 11.92; 95% CI 3.68-38.57), hyperglycemia grade 3-4 for PI3K inhibitors (OR 40.93; 95% CI 10.08-166.22) and diarrhea for anti-HER2 agents (OR 9.93; 95% CI 4.71-20.95). Adding targeted agents to ET is associated with a significant increased risk of AEs. The risk of developing different AEs varies largely according to the type of agent used.",breast_neoplasms
29107861,"To assess the value of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) to breast cancer (BC) patients with no or minimal lymph node (LN) involvement. We retrospectively analysed a French multi-centric cohort of 4283 patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection, with or without PMRT, between 1980 and 2013. Practices were analysed for three treatment periods (1980-1999, 2000-2005 and 2006-2013). The impact of PMRT on loco-regional recurrence (LRR), disease-free survival (DFS), BC-specific survival?and overall survival was assessed in pN0-1mi patients using multivariate analyses (logistic regression and Cox model). It was subsequently assessed based on the number of clinicopathological recurrence-risk factors, generating a prognostic index (French-PMRT index), to isolate a pN0-1mi patients subgroup that might derive a benefit from PMRT. We tested the accuracy of the Cambridge-PMRT (c-PMRT) index to discriminate between patients with significantly different outcomes and the value of PMRT in each c-PMRT prognostic group. More than half of the pN0-1mi patients of our cohort underwent PMRT, which almost significantly improved LRR-free survival and DFS. Matching pN0-1mi patients based on the number of clinicopathologic recurrence-risk factors identified a higher risk subpopulation (??3 recurrence-risk factors), but PMRT did not improve patient outcomes. Although the c-PMRT index had the potential to predict patient outcomes, its use did not help in making the decision of whether or not to use PMRT. We failed to isolate a subgroup of early BC patients without LN involvement suitable for PMRT, despite studying a large cohort.",breast_neoplasms
29106060,"To evaluate the attitudes of patients with different cancers towards research biopsies outside a clinical trial. Patients with metastatic cancer completed a questionnaire that assessed patients' willingness to consider research biopsies. Research biopsies were divided into two groups: biopsies performed as stand-alone procedures (research purposes only biopsy, RPOB) or performed during a clinically indicated biopsy (additional pass biopsy, APB). Factors analyzed included biopsy timing, biopsy site, sociodemographic information and information about prior trial participation. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using random-effects logistic regression. One hundred and sixty-five patients with cancer (40 melanoma, 37 colorectal, 32 breast, 30 lung, 26 prostate) completed the questionnaire. Patients with melanoma demonstrated the greatest willingness to consider a research biopsy compared to patients with other cancer types (P?<?0.05). Patients' ethnicity, time since previous biopsies, time since metastatic diagnosis, and previous trial enrolment were all statistically significant for willingness to consider a research biopsy on univariate analysis. When adjusting for statistically significant variables on univariate analysis, the odds of patients considering APBs were 14.6 times greater than RPOBs (P?<?0.0001). Patients were also more willing to consider having blood or skin taken for research purposes (P?<?0.0001) compared to liver and bone biopsies. Patients with cancer show a greater willingness to consider APBs compared to RPOBs, and biopsies performed at less invasive body sites.

Records were retrieved of all women newly diagnosed with early breast cancer and registered on the Christchurch Breast Cancer Patient Register over 4 years from June 2009. Demographic and pathological factors, dates of starting and stopping endocrine therapies and reported side-effects were collected. The proportion remaining on endocrine therapy was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curve; Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent factors influencing adherence. Of 1213 women, 1018 (83.9%) had oestrogen receptor-positive tumours, of whom 674 (66.2%) started adjuvant endocrine therapy, including 62 (9.2%) neoadjuvantly. Uptake was 52.4% of those with T1 tumours, 89% with T2 tumours, 93% with T3/T4 tumours, 92.7% with node-positive tumours and 49.7% with node-negative tumours. The initial endocrine therapy was an aromatase inhibitor in 254 (38%) and tamoxifen for 412 (61%). At 1 year, 90% remained adherent, at 2 years 84%, at 3 years 81%, at 4 years 76%, at 4.5 years 71% and at 5 years 50%, with a median duration of 60 months (56-64 months, 95% confidence interval) and a median follow-up of 33 months. Overall, 135 (20%) women stopped treatment for adverse events or poor tolerability. A longer persistence with endocrine therapy was associated with node-positive tumours (hazard ratio 1.38, P?=?0.003), but not first hormone used; aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen, P?=?0.76.

We performed a systematic review by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2017. We used the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool and CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) checklist to assess the methodological quality of the diagnostic studies and economic evaluations, respectively. A proportion's meta-analysis approach, 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) and test of heterogeneity (P values) were used for pooled results. Costs are expressed US$ PPP (United States Dollar purchasing power parities). The PROSPERO ID of this Systematic Review's protocol is CRD42014013804. Of 1473 potentially relevant hits, four high-quality studies were included. The pooled cancer detection rate of double reading was 6.01 per 1000 screens (CI: 4.47??-7.77??), and it was 5.65 per 1000 screens (CI: 3.95??-7.65??) for single reading (P=0.76). The pooled proportion of false-positives of double reading was 47.03 per 1000 screens (CI: 39.13??-55.62??) and it was 40.60 per 1000 screens (CI: 38.58??-42.67??) for single reading (P=0.12). One study reported, for double reading, an ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) of 16,684 Euros (24,717 US$ PPP; 2015 value) per detected cancer. Single reading+CAD (computer-aided-detection) was cost-effective in Japan. The evidence of benefit for double reading compared to single reading for digital mammography interpretation is scarce.

29102440,"Women with impalpable or poorly palpable breast cancer require radiologically guided localisation prior to breast conserving surgery. Radioguided Occult Lesion Localisation using Iodine-125 Seed (ROLLIS) is an emerging alternative to conventional Hookwire Localisation (HWL). We compared ROLLIS with conventional HWL with respect to patient reported stress and discomfort related to the localisation procedure. From September 2013 to January 2016, women who were eligible for breast conserving surgery with impalpable or poorly palpable histologically confirmed invasive or in-situ carcinoma were recruited to the multi-centre ROLLIS randomised controlled trial and underwent either ROLLIS or HWL. Following surgery, a questionnaire was administered to each participant regarding the stress and discomfort related to the localisation procedure. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare the primary outcome of patient-reported stress and discomfort between localisation groups. 218 participants with 220 lesions were randomised and underwent breast conserving surgery following localisation. 201 (92.2%) and 202 (92.7%) of participants provided responses to the stress and discomfort components of the questionnaire respectively. HWL was associated with a statistically significant increased odds of greater stress and discomfort when compared to ROLLIS (OR?=?2.07, p?=?0.01 and OR?=?1.94, p?=?0.01 respectively). Insertion of multiple localisation devices was also associated with increased stress (OR?=?5.68, p?<?0.01) and discomfort (OR?=?2.96, p?<?0.01).

The early detection of breast lumps using a breast self-examination (BSE) is important for the prevention and control of this disease. The aim of this study was to examine BSE behavior and its predictive factors among female university students using the Health Belief Model (HBM). This investigation was a cross-sectional survey carried out with 334 female students at Urmia University of Medical Sciences in the northwest of Iran. To collect the necessary data, researchers applied a valid and reliable three-part questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a chi-square test, in addition to multivariate logistic regression statistics in SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results indicated that 82 of the 334 participants (24.6%) reported practicing BSEs. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that high perceived severity [OR?=?2.38, 95% CI?=?(1.02-5.54)], high perceived benefits [OR?=?1.94, 95% CI?=?(1.09-3.46)], and high perceived self-efficacy [OR?=?13.15, 95% CI?=?(3.64-47.51)] were better predictors of BSE behavior (P?<?0.05) than low perceived severity, benefits, and self-efficacy. The findings also showed that a high level of knowledge compared to a low level of knowledge [OR?=?5.51, 95% CI?=?(1.79-16.86)] and academic undergraduate and graduate degrees compared to doctoral degrees [OR?=?2.90, 95% CI?=?(1.42-5.92)] of the participants were predictors of BSE performance (P?<?0.05).

All operated women with non-metastatic primary invasive breast cancer, diagnosed in 2005, were selected from the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Predicted and observed 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) were compared for the overall cohort, separated by oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and predefined subgroups. A >5% difference was considered as clinically relevant. Discriminatory accuracy and goodness-of-fit were determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Chi-squared-test. We included 8834 patients. Discriminatory accuracy for 5-year OS was good (AUC 0.80). For ER-positive and ER-negative patients, AUCs were 0.79 and 0.75, respectively. Predicted 5-year OS differed from observed by -1.4% in the entire cohort, -0.7% in ER-positive and -4.9% in ER-negative patients. Five-year OS was accurately predicted in all subgroups. Discriminatory accuracy for 10-year OS was good (AUC 0.78). For ER-positive and ER-negative patients AUCs were 0.78 and 0.76, respectively. Predicted 10-year OS differed from observed by -1.0% in the entire cohort, -0.1% in ER-positive and -5.3 in ER-negative patients. Ten-year OS was overestimated (6.3%) in patients ??75 years and underestimated (-13.%) in T3 tumours and patients treated with both endocrine therapy and chemotherapy (-6.6%). PREDICT predicts OS reliably in most Dutch breast cancer patients, although results for both 5-year and 10-year OS should be interpreted carefully in ER-negative patients. Furthermore, 10-year OS should be interpreted cautiously in patients ??75 years, T3 tumours and in patients considering endocrine therapy and chemotherapy.",breast_neoplasms
29097953,"The purpose of this case report is to describe the case of a young female athlete with low back pain caused by metastatic breast cancer. A 27-year-old woman presented with low back pain after striking a ball during kickball 3 days earlier. Because of the mechanism of injury and onset, the patient was originally diagnosed with a lumbar spine sprain/strain. After radiographs were obtained and were read as unremarkable, a 2-week trial of care was initiated that included soft-tissue mobilizations, anti-inflammatory medications from her primary care physician, and therapeutic rehabilitation exercises. After this trial concluded, the patient did not improve and continued to be in significant pain. Magnetic resonance imaging was then ordered and revealed an expansile lesion at L2 with cortical compromise. Referral to an oncologist prompted the diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer. Poor response to conservative treatment may indicate the working diagnosis is incorrect and that it must be reconsidered. In this case, a lack of response to care with persistent high severity of pain despite a multimodal approach justified further investigation with advanced imaging, which revealed spinal metastases secondary to breast cancer.

A register-based study was conducted using the Danish Breast Cancer Group?database. The use of SLNB in DCIS patients according to year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, size of lesion, Van Nuys classification, palpability, location?and department of surgery was evaluated. The chi-squared test was used to test differences between the groups. Data from 2618 Danish female patients diagnosed with DCIS between 2004 and 2015 were included; 54.3% of patients underwent SLNB. The use of SLNB increased from 26.6% in 2004 to 65.1% in 2015. A total of 1877 (71.7%) patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and 577 (22.0%) underwent mastectomy, of which 43.9% and 86.0% respectively had a concomitant SLNB.

A significant difference in the use of SLNB with BCS and mastectomy according to department capacity (high-volume departments versus?low-volume departments) was observed. The use of SLNB in patients with DCIS and adherence to the Danish national guidelines varies among Danish breast surgery departments. To optimise the axillary treatment of patients with DCIS, an improved compliance to the national DCIS guidelines is necessary.",breast_neoplasms

29095299,"Rehabilitation for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) has been indicated as necessary. However, there are only a few reports on rehabilitation in PCD. We describe the course of physical and cognitive functions and activities of daily living (ADL) in a patient with PCD and examine the effect of rehabilitation, along with a review of relevant literature. A 42-year-old woman experienced rapid deterioration in cerebellar symptoms and was unable to walk. The cerebellar symptoms improved after mastectomy, which was performed 3 months after the onset of symptoms. However, the cerebellar symptoms exacerbated 11 months after the onset of symptoms. She underwent immunotherapy because the level of anti-Yo antibodies was high, and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were detected. She was diagnosed with anti-Yo antibody-positive PCD caused by breast cancer. Rehabilitation was performed preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 year after the onset of symptoms. Her physical function and ADL improved after the surgery and at 1 year after the onset of symptoms. Finally, she regained the ability to walk between parallel bars supported with one hand and a walking frame. Given the results of this case and the relevant literature, it appears that rehabilitation improves physical function and ADL after oncotherapy. Particularly, initiating treatment within three months of onset of symptoms may enable patients to walk without assistance.",breast_neoplasms
29094413,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a complex and intrinsically aggressive tumour with poor prognosis, and the discovery of targeted small-molecule drugs for TNBC treatment still remains in its infancy. In this study, we aimed to discover a small-molecule agent for TNBC treatment and illuminate its potential mechanisms. Cell viability was detected by using methylthiazoltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Electron microscopy, GFP-LC3 transfection, monodansylcadaverine staining and apoptosis assay were performed to determine Fluoxetine-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Western blotting and siRNA transfection were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of Fluoxetine-induced autophagy. iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms. We have demonstrated that Fluoxetine had remarkable anti-proliferative activities and induced autophagic cell death in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. The mechanism for Fluoxetine-induced autophagic cell death was associated with inhibition of eEF2K and activation of AMPK-mTOR-ULK complex axis. Further iTRAQ-based proteomics and network analyses revealed that Fluoxetine-induced mechanism was involved in BIRC6, BNIP1, SNAP29 and Bif-1. These results demonstrate that Fluoxetine induces apoptosis and autophagic cell death in TNBC, which will hold a promise for the future TNBC therapy.",breast_neoplasms

However, the results remain inconsistent and controversial. To address this inconsistency, we systematically interrogated the aforementioned association via a meta-analysis. Through a literature search, we identified 13 case-control studies, including 12,453 cases and 14,056 case-free controls. The strengths of reported associations were evaluated using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).

29082793,"Under the American Affordable Care Act, Medicare insurance beneficiaries receive free Annual Wellness Visits (AWV); there is a need to examine the effectiveness of these visits. The purpose of this study is to examine their impact on subsequent screening rates. Using 2011-2014 Medicare FFS (fee-for-service) claims data, seven preventive care services, including vaccinations and cancer screenings were compared among beneficiaries who received and did not receive AWVs. Inverse probability treatment weights were used to achieve covariate balance between groups. Nonrecipients were less likely to receive any of the 7 services compared with recipients of AWVs (63% vs 88%). The total number of services that the AWVs group received was 62% higher than nonrecipients. Subgroup analyses show that wellness visits were high across age groups, race/ethnic groups, rural/urban context, and counties of different economic development status. These results are consistent with the view that wellness visits improve screening rates and thus serve to reduce cancer burden.",breast_neoplasms

This was a retrospective survey of all deaths in women aged 15-49 years at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital that occurred from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Data retrieved from ward registers, death registers, and death certificates were analyzed with Epi Info version 7. Comparison of socioeconomic and demographic risk factors for maternal and nonmaternal deaths was done using a multivariate logistic regression model. p<0.05). Older women aged >30 years (odd ratio =1.86, 95% CI =1.07-3.23) and employed women (odds ratio =2.55, 95% CI =1.46-4.45) were more likely to die from nonmaternal than maternal causes. Most of the deaths were nonmaternal. Infectious diseases, diseases of the circulatory system, and malignant neoplasms were the major causes of death among WRA, with maternal deaths accounting for approximately a quarter. Public health programs educating women on safer sex practices, early screening for cancers, benefits of antenatal care, and skilled attendants at delivery will go a long way to reducing preventable causes of deaths among these women.",breast_neoplasms
29078898,"Despite massive expenditures in preclinical studies, many breast cancer agents show efficacy in murine models but fail in human trials. In humans, metastatic disease determines survival, but preclinical murine models only evaluate drug efficacy against the primary tumor. We hypothesized that evaluating efficacy against metastatic breast cancer would more efficiently predict efficacy in a murine model than evaluating the primary tumor alone. This study (1) critically evaluated a murine tumor removal model with metastatic tumor burden quantification for breast cancer preclinical trials and (2) validated the model with an agent that previously passed preclinical trials but failed human trials. Tumorectomy and Halsted (radical) mastectomy procedures after inoculation of 4T1-luc2 cells were compared. The effect of AZD0530, an oral Src inhibitor that passed preclinical trials but failed human trials, was evaluated using an inoculation model with/without Halsted mastectomy. Significant amounts of residual disease were confirmed by bioluminescence (P?=?0.003) and 100% developed local recurrence after tumorectomy versus 14% (P?=?0.005) after Halsted mastectomy. Bioluminescence value at 15?min after luciferin injection highly correlated with peak except for 24?h after injection. AZD0530 significantly suppressed primary tumor burden compared with no treatment (P?=?0.002); but not in lung metastases. In a Halsted mastectomy model, AZD0530 had no efficacy against lung metastases or difference in survival. We critically evaluated and established a murine mastectomy model to evaluate metastatic tumors. It provides a new model for preclinical drug development that mimics the human adjuvant setting.",breast_neoplasms

However, the extent and depth of the problem has never been examined in the Japanese population. The aim of this study was to describe the status of cancer patients in the AYA population, using data from the hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR). Patients included in the HBCR from January 2011 to December 2014 were included in this study to evaluate the incidence and cancer distribution trends among AYA. The total number and the proportion of AYA (15-39 years of age) stratified by sex, age, and cancer type were obtained. The incidence of age-specific cancer among AYA was also calculated. We identified 30,394 male (35.1%) and 56,100 female (64.9%) cancer patients in the population, which collectively constituted about 3% of all invasive cancer cases. The incidence of cancer in AYA was estimated as 86.2 per 100,000 per year, and increased with age. The most affected population was women between 35 and 39 years of age (35%). Breast cancer was the most common type of cancer, followed by cervical, uterine, and thyroid cancers. A substantial number of AYA are diagnosed with cancer every year. The distribution of cancer types in AYA was dependent on age and sex.

To achieve better outcomes in reconstructed breasts, several factors should be considered to determine the optimal surgical method. A total of 108 patients who underwent oncoplastic surgery from January 2013 to December 2016 were retrospectively investigated. We used various methods, including glandular tissue reshaping, latissimus dorsi (LD) flap transposition, and reduction oncoplasty, to restore the breast volume and symmetry. The mean weight of the tumor specimens was 40.46 g, and the ratio of the tumor specimen weight to breast volume was 0.12 g/mL in the patients who underwent glandular tissue reshaping (n=59). The corresponding values were 101.47 g and 0.14 g/mL, respectively, in the patients who underwent reduction oncoplasty (n=17), and 82.54 g and 0.20 g/mL, respectively, in those treated with an LD flap (n=32). Glandular tissue reshaping was mostly performed in the upper outer quadrant, and LD flap transposition was mostly performed in the lower inner quadrant. No major complications were noted. Most patients were satisfied with the aesthetic results. We report satisfactory outcomes of oncoplastic surgical procedures in Korean patients. The results regarding specimen weight and the tumor-to-breast ratio of Asian patients will be a helpful reference point for determining the most appropriate oncoplastic surgical technique.",breast_neoplasms
29075110,"Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the initiation, recurrence, and metastasis of breast cancer. Sufficient evidence has established that breast cancer cells can spontaneously turn into breast CSCs. Thus, it is essential to simultaneously target breast CSCs and cancer cells to maximize the efficacy of breast cancer therapy. HER2 has been found to be overexpressed in both breast CSCs and cancer cells. We developed salinomycin-loaded polymer-lipid hybrid anti-HER2 nanoparticles (Sali-NP-HER2) to target both HER2-positive breast CSCs and cancer cells. The antitumor activity of Sali-NP-HER2 constructed by conjugating anti-HER2 antibodies to polymer-lipid salinomycin nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Sali-NP-HER2 efficiently bound to HER2-positive breast CSCs and cancer cells, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic effects compared with non-targeted nanoparticles or salinomycin. In mice bearing breast cancer xenografts, administration of Sali-NP-HER2 exhibited superior efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth. Sali-NP-HER2 reduced the breast tumorsphere formation rate and the proportion of breast CSCs more effectively than non-targeted nanoparticles or salinomycin alone. Sali-NP-HER2 represents a promising approach in treating HER2-positive breast cancer by targeting both breast CSCs and cancer cells.",breast_neoplasms
29073170,"To assess whether strain histograms are equal to strain ratios in predicting breast tumour malignancy and to see if either could be used to upgrade Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 tumours for immediate biopsy. Ninety-nine breast tumours were examined using B-mode BI-RADS scorings and strain elastography. Strain histograms and ratios were assessed, and areas- under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUROC) for each method calculated. In BI-RADS 3 tumours cut-offs for strain histogram and ratio values were calculated to see if some tumours could be upgraded for immediate biopsy. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the effect of tumour depth and size, and breast density on strain elastography. Forty-four of 99 (44.4%) tumours were malignant. AUROC of BI-RADS, strain histograms and strain ratios were 0.949, 0.830 and 0.794 respectively. There was no significant difference between AUROCs of strain histograms and strain ratios (P = 0.405), while they were both inferior to BI-RADS scoring (P<0.001, P = 0.008). Four out of 26 BI-RADS 3 tumours were malignant. When cut-offs of 189 for strain histograms and 1.44 for strain ratios were used to upgrade BI-RADS 3 tumours, AUROCS were 0.961 (Strain histograms and BI-RADS) and 0.941 (Strain ratios and BI-RADS). None of them was significantly different from BI-RADS scoring alone (P = 0.249 and P = 0.414). Tumour size and depth, and breast density influenced neither strain histograms (P = 0.196, P = 0.115 and P = 0.321) nor strain ratios (P = 0.411, P = 0.596 and P = 0.321). Strain histogram analyses are reliable and easy to do in breast cancer diagnosis and perform comparably to strain ratio analyses.

29069885,"Breast-conserving therapy is defined as a breast-conserving wide local excision (WLE) of a mammary tumour combined with postoperative radiotherapy. Immediate restoration of the mammary shape by use of breast reduction techniques (volume displacement) or tissue replacement techniques (volume replacement) is gaining popularity to prevent breast malformation. To date, using the internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) flap has been suggested for immediate volume replacement after WLE, but has never been evaluated in a published study. We applied this flap in 12 women (mean age, 56.1 years) after WLE (mean specimen weight, 46.5 g) of the medial aspect of the breast. Over a median follow-up of 35.3 months (standard deviation, 1.2 months), 4 women needed repeated surgery for dog-ear correction of the donor site. In our experience, the use of an IMAP flap was a reliable technique with good cosmetic outcomes after oncoplastic reconstruction.

We searched for relevant available literatures on miR-210 and cancer until November 1st, 2016 on the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct database. We calculated the pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS, which compared the high and low expression levels of miR-210 in patients of the available studies. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the specific role of miR-210 in ethnicity and the type of cancers. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg funnel plots and Egger regression test. Overall, 19 studies were involved in this meta-analysis. The result indicated that upregulated miR-210 might be associated with poor OS outcome in various carcinomas, with the pooled HR of 1.80 (95% CI: 1.29-2.51). When stratified by disease, significant results were detected in breast cancer (HR?=?2.67, 95% CI: 1.24-5.76) and glioma (HR?=?2.42, 95% CI: 1.32-4.43). Besides, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant results were detected only in Asian populations (HR?=?2.14, 95% CI: 1.37-3.34). The present meta-analysis suggests that high expressed miR-210 is significantly associated with OS in cancer patients, which has the potential to be a prognostic marker in cancers.",breast_neoplasms
29066887,"With the wide recognition of oncostatic effect of melatonin, the current study proposes a potential breast cancer target multimodality treatment based on melatonin-loaded magnetic nanocomposite particles (Melatonin-MNPs). Melatonin-MNPs were fabricated by the single emulsion solvent extraction/evaporation method. Based on the facilitated transport of melatonin by the GLUT overexpressed on the cell membrane, such Melatonin-MNPs can be more favorably uptaken by MCF-7 cells compared with the melatonin-free nanocomposite particles, which indicates the cancer targeting ability of melatonin molecule. Inductive heating can be generated by exposure to the Melatonin-MNPs internalized within cancer cells under alternative magnetic field, so as to achieve the ""inside-out"" magnetic nano-thermotherapy. In addition to demonstrating the superior cytotoxic effect of such nano-thermotherapy over the conventional exogenous heating by metal bath, more importantly, the sustainable release of melatonin from the Melatonin-MNPs can be greatly promoted upon responsive to the magnetic heating. The multimodality treatment based on Melatonin-MNPs can lead to more significant decrease in cell viability than any single treatment, suggesting the potentiated effect of melatonin on the cytotoxic response to nano-thermotherapy. This study is the first to fabricate the precisely engineered melatonin-loaded multifunctional nanocomposite particles and demonstrate the potential in breast cancer target multimodality treatment.",breast_neoplasms

To document the prevalence of, and factors associated with, low desire, sexually related personal distress, hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction (HSDD), and pelvic floor dysfunction in women 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis. This was a prospective, observational, community-based cohort study of Australian women with invasive breast cancer recruited within 12 months of diagnosis. 1,053 of the 1,305 who completed the initial 5 years of study follow-up agreed to be re-contacted, and 992 of these women alive 10 years after diagnosis were sent the study questionnaire. The main outcome measure was HSDD determined by a score no higher than 5.0 on the desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) plus a score of at least 11.0 on the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R). Pelvic floor disorders, including urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse, were assessed using validated questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with low desire, personal distress, and HSDD. 625 completed questionnaires were returned. The respondents' median age was 65.1 years (range?=?36.4-95.5). Current AI use was reported by 10% and tamoxifen use was reported by 3.4%. 521 of the 608 women (85.7%; 95% CI?= 82.9-88.5) who competed the FSFI desire domain had low sexual desire, and 246 of the 563 women (43.7%; 95% CI?= 39.6-47.8%) who completed the FSDS-R had sexually related personal distress. 221 of the 559 women (39.5%; 95% CI?= 35.5-43.6%) who completed the 2 questionnaires had HSDD. Current AI users were more likely to have HSDD than non-users (55.2% [95% CI?= 42.2-68.1] vs 37.8% [95% CI?= 33.5-42.0]; P?= .01). HSDD was more prevalent in sexually active, current AI users (66.7%; 95% CI?= 49.4-83.9) vs current non-users (43.6%; 95% CI?= 37.0-50.2; P?= .02). In a logistic regression model, HSDD was significantly associated with current AI use and inversely associated with age.

We randomly chose 32 patients from our database who underwent both DIBH and FB treatment planning. Contouring of the axillary lymph node levels (LI, LII, and LIII) was performed retrospectively according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas. We assessed the center of mass of each level and the planning target volume, as well as the dose distribution (Dmean, Dmedian, Dmax, Dmin, V30, and V40) in the lymph node levels I-III. Subsequently center of mass movement and dose changes due to deep inspiration treatment planning were calculated. All lymph node levels showed significant (P<.001) movement in anterior and cranial directions due to DIBH. The overall median movement (range) in the x (lateral), y (anterior-posterior), and z (cranio-caudal) directions was 0.1?cm (0.0-1.1?cm), 0.9?cm (0.1-2.0?cm), and 1.2?cm (0.0-2.6?cm), respectively. Movement of the planning target volume showed significant correlation (r=0.72, r=0.63, r=0.63; P<.05) with levels I-III. The average Dmean during FB/DIBH was as follows: LI 33.9?Gy/30.8?Gy?(P<.001), LII 23.7?Gy/24.1?Gy?(P=.74), and LIII 14.0?Gy/15.6?Gy?(P=.14).

29065872,"Somatic mutations accumulate in human cells throughout life. Some may have no adverse consequences, but some of them may lead to cancer. A cancer genome is typically unstable, and thus more mutations can accumulate in the DNA of cancer cells. An ongoing problem is to figure out which mutations are drivers - play a role in oncogenesis, and which are passengers - do not play a role. One way of addressing this question is through inspection of somatic mutations in DNA of cancer samples from a cohort of patients and detection of patterns that differentiate driver from passenger mutations. We propose QuaDMutEx, a method that incorporates three novel elements: a new gene set penalty that includes non-linear penalization of multiple mutations in putative sets of driver genes, an ability to adjust the method to handle slow- and fast-evolving tumors, and a computationally efficient method for finding gene sets that minimize the penalty, through a combination of heuristic Monte Carlo optimization and exact binary quadratic programming. Compared to existing methods, the proposed algorithm finds sets of putative driver genes that show higher coverage and lower excess coverage in eight sets of cancer samples coming from brain, ovarian, lung, and breast tumors. Superior ability to improve on both coverage and excess coverage on different types of cancer shows that QuaDMutEx is a tool that should be part of a state-of-the-art toolbox in the driver gene discovery pipeline. It can detect genes harboring rare driver mutations that may be missed by existing methods.

A total of 965 patients with painful bone metastases undergoing palliative radiation therapy at a tertiary referral center between 1999 and 2007 were identified. Pain scores were measured at 1, 2, and 3?months after radiation therapy. Pain response was defined as at least a 2-point decrease on a pain score scale of 0-10, without increase in analgesics, or an analgesic decrease of at least 25% without an increase in pain score. Thirteen candidate predictors were identified from the literature and expert experience. After multiple imputation, final predictors were selected using stepwise regression and collapsed into a prediction model. Model performance was evaluated by calibration and discrimination and corrected for optimism. Overall 462 patients (47.9%) showed a response. Primary tumor site, performance status, and baseline pain score were predictive for pain response, with a corrected c-statistic of 0.63. The predicted response rates after radiation therapy increased from 37.5% for patients with the highest risk score to 79.8% for patients with the lowest risk score and were in good agreement with the observed response rates. A prediction score for pain response after palliative radiation therapy was developed. The model performance was moderate, showing that prediction of pain response is difficult.

29061827,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an antimicrobial protein secreted from mammary, salivary and other mucosal glands. It is an important member of heme peroxidase enzymes and the primary peroxidase enzyme present in breast tissues. In addition to the antimicrobial properties, LPO has been shown to be associated with breast cancer etiology. Heterocyclic amines, an important class of environmental and dietary carcinogens, have been increasingly associated with breast cancer etiology. Heterocyclic amines undergo activation in breast tissue as a result of oxidation by LPO. The current study includes three important heterocyclic amines, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methy-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]-pyridine (PhIP), that have carcinogenic activity. The structural binding characterization of IQ, MeIQx and PhIP with LPO was done using in silico approaches. Their binding pattern and interactions with LPO amino acid residues were analyzed. The three compounds bound in the distal heme cavity of LPO without replacing the important water molecule required for oxidation of substrate compounds. PhIP displayed lesser binding affinity for LPO in comparison to IQ and MeIQx. The binding mode of heterocyclic amines in distal heme cavity of LPO resembled to that of substrate binding pattern. The three heterocyclic amines are suggested to act as LPO substrate. The undisturbed water molecule present in distal heme cavity of the LPO is expected to facilitate the oxidation and activation of the three heterocyclic amines. These activated compounds may potentially bind with DNA in breast tissues forming DNA adducts and may subsequently lead to breast cancer initiation.",breast_neoplasms

The aim of this study was to compare the immunological activities or both purified samples and commercially available mixtures containing fucoidan. We evaluated the effects of various samples on phagocytosis, mitogenic response, natural killer (NK) activity, antibody formation and inhibition of breast cancer growth. We found significant immunostimulating activity, but the strength of these effects was different among individual samples.

Her family history was significant for astrocytoma, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed a BAP1 mutation in the proband. Although there have been reports of sarcomas and meningiomas in patients affected with BAP1 mutations, to our knowledge malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in this patient population have not been previously reported.

29061142,"Most cancer risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding and it is challenging to assess their functional impacts. To systematically identify the SNPs that affect gene expression by modulating activities of distal regulatory elements, we adapt the self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) strategy, a high-throughput technique to functionally quantify enhancer activities. From 10,673 SNPs linked with 996 cancer risk-associated SNPs identified in previous GWAS studies, we identify 575 SNPs in the fragments that positively regulate gene expression, and 758 SNPs in the fragments with negative regulatory activities. Among them, 70 variants are regulatory variants for which the two alleles confer different regulatory activities. We analyze in depth two regulatory variants-breast cancer risk SNP rs11055880 and leukemia risk-associated SNP rs12142375-and demonstrate their endogenous regulatory activities on expression of ATF7IP and PDE4B genes, respectively, using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. By identifying regulatory variants associated with cancer susceptibility and studying their molecular functions, we hope to help the interpretation of GWAS results and provide improved information for cancer risk assessment.",breast_neoplasms

This multi-cohort phase II randomised discontinuation trial?explored anticancer activity of cabozantinib in nine tumour types. Cabozantinib was administered (100?mg, once daily) to patients with advanced, recurrent?or metastatic cancers. Those with stable disease at week 12 were randomised 1:1 to cabozantinib or placebo. Primary end-points were objective response rate (ORR) at week 12 and progression-free survival (PFS) in the randomised phase. A total of 526 patients were enrolled. The highest ORR was observed in ovarian cancer (OC) (21.7%); the largest PFS benefit was observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (median 5.5 versus 1.4 months for placebo; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.52). Disease control rates were >40% for CRPC, OC, melanoma, metastatic breast cancer (MBC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer. Median duration of response ranged from 3.3 (MBC) to 11.2 months (OC). Encouraging efficacy results and symptomatic improvements prompted early suspension of the randomised stage and conversion to open-label non-randomised expansion cohorts. Dose reductions to manage adverse events (AEs) occurred in 48.7% of patients. The most frequent grade III-IV AEs were fatigue (12.4%), diarrhoea (10.5%), hypertension (10.5%)?and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (8.7%). Clinical antitumour activity of cabozantinib was observed in a subset of tumour types: CRPC and OC were evaluated further in expansion cohorts. Phase III programs were initiated in CRPC and HCC.

Although genetic susceptibility to breast cancer in the general population is well studied, large-scale evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility after chest-directed radiotherapy for childhood cancer is lacking. We conducted a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in female survivors of childhood cancer, pooling two cohorts with detailed treatment data and systematic, long-term follow-up: the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. The study population comprised 207 survivors who developed breast cancer and 2774 who had not developed any subsequent neoplasm as of last follow-up. Genotyping and subsequent imputation yielded 16?958?466 high-quality variants for analysis. We tested associations in the overall population and in subgroups stratified by receipt of lower than 10 and 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure. We report P values and pooled per-allele risk estimates from Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Among survivors who received 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure, a locus on 1q41 was associated with subsequent breast cancer risk (rs4342822, nearest gene PROX1 , risk allele frequency in control subjects [RAF controls ] = 0.46, hazard ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 2.44, P = 7.09????10 -9 ).

We retrospectively examined 148 women with recurrent uterine carcinosarcoma who received salvage chemotherapy within a cohort of 906 uterine carcinosarcomas. An independent association of salvage chemotherapy type and SAR was examined with multivariate analysis. There were 71 (48.0%) women who received a taxane/platinum regimen. On univariate analysis, women who received a taxane/platinum doublet had a higher 2-year SAR rate compared to women who received non-taxane/platinum regimens (55.5% versus 34.8%, P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, use of taxane/platinum regimen was independently associated with improved SAR compared to the non-taxane/platinum regimens (adjusted-hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35 to 0.91, P=0.02). When stratified by disease-free interval, women with a disease-free interval ??6months who received a taxane/platinum doublet had a higher 2-year SAR rate compared to those who received non-taxane/platinum regimens (61.9% versus 40.0%, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75, P=0.002); conversely, in women with a disease-free interval <6months, 2-year SAR rates were similar between the two groups (20.5% versus 18.4%, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.90, P=0.61). Among women who received a taxane/platinum doublet as adjuvant chemotherapy, re-treatment with taxane/platinum doublet as salvage chemotherapy remained beneficial (2-year SAR rate, 62.1% versus 39.7%, HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86, P=0.019).

The systematic literature search included the electronic databases and the proceedings of oncologic meetings. Treatment effects on PFS and OS were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs); treatment effects on RR were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). A weighted regression analysis was performed on log-transformed treatment effect estimates to test the association between treatment effects on the surrogate outcome and treatment effects on the clinical outcome. 2?=?0.32; 95% CI, 0.02-0.76; P?=?0.01, respectively). The pre-planned analyses stratifying trials according to different type of disease and different mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors showed a very weak association of the RR with the OS for non-small cell lung cancer indicated and a modest association of the RR with the PFS for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 checkpoint inhibitors.

In this study we evaluated the frequency of outpatient office visits among a cohort of early stage breast cancer survivors after completion of 4 different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens to better understand how differences in toxicities between regimens might affect health care use. We analyzed administrative claims data from a US commercial insurance database (OptumLabs) to identify women who received adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), AC followed or preceded by docetaxel or paclitaxel (AC-T), AC concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel (TAC), or docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC) between 2008 and 2014. We compared mean numbers of visits per patient (adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, region, year, surgery type, radiation, chronic conditions, and previous hospitalizations) across the different regimens (TC?= reference) for 12 months, starting 4 months after the end of chemotherapy. In 6247 eligible patients, the mean adjusted number of outpatient visits per patient was significantly higher in patients who received AC-T (8.1) or TAC (7.3) than TC (6.5) or AC (6.0; P?< .001 for comparisons of AC-T and TAC with TC), primarily because of differences in Medical Oncology visits. Approximately 40% did not see a primary care provider at all during this time frame. AC-T and TAC are associated with more subsequent outpatient visits than TC.

29052503,"Women treated for breast cancer are followed-up for monitoring of treatment effectiveness and for detecting recurrences at an early stage. The type of follow-up received may affect women's reassurance and impact on their quality of life. Anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer has been described, but little is known about how the intensity of the follow-up can affect women's psychological status. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of intensive vs. less-intensive follow-up on different health outcomes, to determine what are women's preferences and values regarding the follow-up received, and also assess the costs of these different types of follow-up. A systematic review following standard Cochrane Collaboration methods was carried out to assess the efficacy of intensive follow-up versus non-intensive follow-up in breast cancer patients. Two additional reviews on women's preferences and economic evidence were also carried out. The search was performed up to January 2016 in: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PDQ, McMaster Health Systems Evidence, CENTRAL, and NHS EED (through The Cochrane Library). The quality of evidence was assessed by GRADE (for quantitative studies) and CerQUAL (for qualitative studies). Several outcomes including mortality, breast cancer recurrences, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were evaluated. Six randomised trials (corresponding to 3534 women) were included for the evaluation of health outcomes; three studies were included for women's values and preferences and four for an economic assessment. There is moderate certainty of evidence showing that intensive follow-up, including more frequent diagnostic tests or visits, does not have effects on 5- or 10-year overall mortality and recurrences in women with breast cancer, compared with less intensive follow-up. Regarding women's preferences and values, there was important variability among studies and within studies (low confidence due to risk of bias and inconsistency). Furthermore, intensive follow-up, as opposed to less intensive follow-up, is not likely to be cost-effective. Less intensive follow-up appears to be justified and can be recommended over intensive follow-up. Resources could thus be mobilised to other aspects of breast cancer care, or other areas of healthcare.",breast_neoplasms
29051317,"To investigate the expression of epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (ECT2) in invasive breast cancer and its prognostic significance. ECT2 immunohistochemical detection was performed in 165 breast cancer specimens and 100 normal control tissues. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis was used to confirm independent prognostic factors. The PHREG procedure linear hypotheses testing method was used to analyse survival data. Expression of ECT2 in breast cancer was significantly higher than that of the normal control group (p<0.001), and it was related to tumour grade, the status of lymph node metastasis, TNM staging, recurrence status, menopausal status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index (p<0.05), and not related to age, tumour size, tumour type, expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor 2, and triple-negative disease (p>0.05). Univariable analysis showed that expression of ECT2, the status of lymph node metastasis, triple-negative disease and Ki-67 proliferation index were related to the overall survival of patients with breast cancer (p<0.001, p=0.006, p=0.001, p=0.041, respectively). PHREG procedure linear hypotheses testing results for overall survival revealed that high expression of ECT2, lymph node metastasis, triple-negative disease and high Ki-67 proliferation index predicted lower overall survival rates. Multivariable Cox regression indicated that high expression of ECT2 and triple-negative disease were independent prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer (p<0.001, p=0.004, respectively). Expression of ECT2 may be one of the main causes of the occurrence and development of breast cancer, and high expression of ECT2 as an independent prognostic factor predicts a poor prognosis.

29049466,"Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma, is increasing in incidence. However, many practitioners who treat patients with breast cancer are not aware of this disease. To assess how BIA-ALCL develops, its risk factors, diagnosis, and subsequent treatment and to disseminate information about this entity to the medical field. A literature review was performed in an academic medical setting. All review articles, case reports, original research articles, and any other articles relevant to BIA-ALCL were included. Data on BIA-ALCL, such as pathophysiology, patient demographics, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, were extracted. Particular focus was paid to age, time to onset, implant type, initial symptoms, treatment, and survival. The search was conducted in January 2017 for studies published in any year. After duplicates were excluded, 304 relevant articles were assessed, and 115 were included from the first documented case in August 1997 through January 2017. Thirty review articles, 44 case reports or series, 15 original research articles, and 26 ""other"" articles (eg, techniques, special topics, letters) were reviewed. A total of 93 cases have been reported in the literature, and with the addition of 2 unreported cases from the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 95 patients were included in this systematic review. Almost all documented BIA-ALCL cases have been associated with a textured device. The underlying mechanism is thought to be due to chronic inflammation from indolent infections, leading to malignant transformation of T cells that are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative and CD30 positive. The mean time to presentation is approximately 10 years after implant placement, with 55 of 83 (66%) patients initially seen with an isolated late-onset seroma and 7 of 83 (8%) with an isolated new breast mass. Ultrasonography with fluid aspiration can be used for diagnosis. Treatment must include removal of the implant and surrounding capsule. More advanced disease may require chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and lymph node dissection.

Forty-three dyads with breast and prostate cancer (N?=?86 participants) were enrolled in an interpersonal telephone counselling intervention. Audio recordings of 228 counselling sessions were transcribed and content analysed qualitatively to identify major themes and key concerns. A total of three 30-min sessions were coded for each study participant. Quantitative data and statistical analyses were used to predict changes in survivors' quality of life. Participants completed psychosocial well-being measures (depression, positive/negative affect, and relationship satisfaction), pre- and post-counselling. Survivors' concerns focused on cancer- and treatment-related issues, whereas partners' concerns centred on the well-being of their spouse/partner with cancer, and what they were doing to help their loved one cope with his/her illness. Key concerns for all consisted of relationship maintenance and communication issues. Further, discussion of these concerns was predictive of significant improvements in adjustment post-counselling for women with breast cancer.

Because ADC tumour cell targets do not have to be drivers of tumour growth, ADCs are potentially relevant for a wide range of tumours currently lacking clear oncogenic drivers. Therefore, we aimed to define the landscape of ADC targets in a broad range of tumours. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for ADCs that are or were evaluated in clinical trials. Gene expression profiles of 18?055 patient-derived tumour samples representing 60 tumour (sub)types and 3520 healthy tissue samples were collected from the public domain. Next, we applied Functional Genomic mRNA-profiling to predict per tumour type the overexpression rate at the protein level of ADC targets with healthy tissue samples as a reference. We identified 87 ADCs directed against 59 unique targets. A predicted overexpression rate of????10% of samples for multiple ADC targets was observed for high-incidence tumour types like breast cancer (n?=?31 with n?=?23 in triple negative breast cancer), colorectal cancer (n?=?18), lung adenocarcinoma (n?=?18), squamous cell lung cancer (n?=?16) and prostate cancer (n?=?5).

This study compared disease-free survival and toxicity between PLD-based and conventional anthracycline-based regimens as adjuvant treatments for early-stage breast cancer. We analyzed disease-free survival (DFS) rates, and adverse events in 102 women with early-stage (I-IIIa) breast cancer who received adjuvant PLD-based chemotherapy from 2002 to 2008. Each patient was matched for age, stage at diagnosis, HER-2 expression and hormone therapy use to a patient treated with an epirubicin-based regimen. Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square tests were used for categorical data analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models were used to analyze DFS. DFS at 5 years was 81.3% for PLD-based regimen and 82.3% for epirubicin-based regimen. This difference was not significant (p = 0.939). Stage IIIa disease was associated with a shorter DFS in univariate analysis (p = 0.048). In multivariate analysis that controlled for adjuvant treatment, age at diagnosis, stage, HER-2 expression, type of surgery and hormone and radiation therapy, stage IIIa disease (P = 0.023) and lack of hormone therapy (P = 0.024) were each independently associated with shorter DFS. Adverse events were evaluated, and with the exception of hand-foot syndrome, more grade 3 and 4 toxicities occurred in patients who received epirubicin-based regimens than in those given PLD-based regimens. For patients with early-stage breast cancer who received PLD-based adjuvant chemotherapy, 5-year DFS was comparable and toxicity was acceptable, yet different from those of patients who received epirubicin-based regimens.",breast_neoplasms

To determine the association between BRCA status and IBC, the authors evaluated its rate and compared the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with IBC with those of patients with other breast cancers (non-IBC). Patients who presented at the study institution's cancer genetics program and who underwent BRCA genetic testing were included in the current study. The authors compared clinicopathologic data between patients with IBC and those with non-IBC using propensity score matching to identify predictors. A total of 1789 patients who underwent BRCA genetic testing (1684 with non-IBC and 105 with IBC) were included. BRCA pathogenic variants were found in 27.3% of patients with non-IBC and 18.1% of patients with IBC (P?=?.0384). After propensity score matching, there were no significant differences noted between patients with IBC and those with non-IBC, including the rate of BRCA pathogenic variants (P?=?.5485). However, a subgroup analysis of the 479 patients with BRCA pathogenic variants demonstrated that patients with IBC (19 patients) were diagnosed at significantly younger ages compared with patients with non-IBC (P?=?.0244). There was no clear association observed between BRCA pathogenic variants and IBC. However, among patients who tested positive for BRCA pathogenic variants, those with IBC were younger at the time of diagnosis compared with those with non-IBC breast cancers. These results confirm that genetic testing is important for patients with IBC who meet the current clinical criteria for genetic testing in breast cancer.

We evaluated PAK5 and p65 staining in breast cancer tissues (BCTs) and paired non-cancerous tissues (NTs) using tissue microarray (TMA) technology. The functions of PAK5 were studied in vitro and in vivo. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were performed to determine proliferation of breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation assay and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were employed to identify the regulation mechanism of p65 by PAK5. The activation of Cyclin D1 promoter was measured with luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft models in nude mice were established to explore the roles of PAK5 in breast cancer growth. In this study, we show that PAK5 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and the increased PAK5 is significantly associated with breast cancer progression. Overexpression of PAK5 promotes the proliferation and cell-cycle progression by increasing the expression of Cyclin D1 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that PAK5 can promote the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-??B). Furthermore, p65 can directly bind to the promoter of Cyclin D1 and mediate an increase in its protein expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that PAK5 may serve as a potential prognosis marker and therapeutic target for human breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Recurrence and survival seem to be improved only in postmenopausal patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated whether MAF amplification (a biomarker for bone metastasis) in primary tumours could predict the treatment outcomes of adjuvant zoledronic acid. The study population included patients enrolled in the international, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 AZURE trial at eligible UK sites who had stage II or III breast cancer and who gave consent for use of their primary tumour samples. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy alone (control group) or with zoledronic acid every 3-4 weeks for six doses, then every 3-6 months until the end of 5 years. Minimisation took into account the number of involved axillary lymph nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen-receptor status, type and timing of systemic therapy, menopausal status, statin use, and treating centre. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival; the secondary endpoint, invasive-disease-free survival, was the primary disease endpoint for the analysis in this report. MAF amplification was assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation of two cores of breast tumour tissue in a microarray, done in a central laboratory by technicians unaware of treatment assignment. We used multivariate analyses to assess disease outcomes by intention to treat. We also assessed interactions between MAF-positive status and menopausal status on efficacy of zoledronic acid. The AZURE trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN79831382. 1739 AZURE patients contributed primary tumour samples, of whom 865 (50%) had two assessable cores (445 in the control groups and 420 in the zoledronic acid group). 184 (21%) tumours were MAF positive (85 in the control groups and 99 in the zoledronic acid group) and the remaining tumours were MAF negative. At a median follow-up of 84??6 months (IQR 72??0-95??8), MAF status was not prognostic for invasive-disease-free survival in the control group (MAF-positive vs MAF-negative: hazard ratio [HR] 0??92, 95% CI 0??59-1??41), but was in the zoledronic acid group (0??52, 0??36-0??75). In patients with MAF-negative tumours, zoledronic acid was associated with higher invasive-disease-free survival than was control treatment (HR 0??74, 95% CI 0??56-0??98), but not in patients who had MAF-positive tumours. Additionally, among 121 patients not postmenopausal at randomisation with MAF-positive tumours, zoledronic acid was associated with lower invasive-disease-free survival (HR 2??47, 95% CI 1??23-4??97) and overall survival (2??27, 95% CI 1??04-4??93) than control treatment. MAF status can predict likelihood of benefit from adjuvant zoledronic acid and merits further investigation as a potential companion diagnostic. Novartis Global and Inbiomotion.",breast_neoplasms
29037220,"Accumulating evidences indicate that circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs, play important roles in tumorigenesis. However, the function of circRNAs in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is largely unknown. We performed circRNA microarrays to identify circRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in TNBC cell lines. Expression levels of a significantly upregulated circRNA, circGFRA1, was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in TNBC cell lines and tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to explore the significance of circGFRA1 in clinical prognosis. Then, we examined the functions of circGFRA1 in TNBC by cell proliferation, apoptosis and mouse xenograft assay. In addition, luciferase assay was used to explore the miRNA sponge function of circGFRA1 in TNBC. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR verified a circRNA termed circGFRA1 that was upregulated in TNBC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that upregulated circGFRA1 was correlated with poorer survival. Knockdown of circGFRA1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in TNBC. Via luciferase reporter assays, circGFRA1 and GFRA1 was observed to directly bind to miR-34a. Subsequent experiments showed that circGFRA1 and GFRA1 regulated the expression of each other by sponging miR-34a. Taken together, we conclude that circGFRA1 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate GFRA1 expression through sponging miR-34a to exert regulatory functions in TNBC. circGFRA1 may be a diagnostic biomarker and potential target for TNBC therapy.",breast_neoplasms

The questionnaire covered participants' demographic and clinical characteristics, change to job status, timing of and reasons for job resignation, screening experience regarding work-related difficulties by healthcare providers, and information/support needs at four distinct timings (at diagnosis, between diagnosis and initial treatment, between initial treatment and return-to-work, and after return-to-work). The results of 950 participants were eligible for statistical analysis. Only 23.5% of participants were screened about work-related issues by healthcare providers despite 21.3% participants reporting resigning at least once. Among participants who resigned, 40.2% decided to do so before initial treatment began. Regarding reasons for resignation, self-regulating and pessimistic reasons were ranked highly. Respondents' work-related information and support needs were observed to change over time. While treatment-related information (schedule and cost) was ranked highly at diagnosis, the need for more individually tailored information and support on work increased after treatment began. This study provides important basic data for developing effective support systems for working survivors of cancer in hospital settings.",breast_neoplasms

29032999,"Radiation therapy is proven to reduce local recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer. To reduce toxicity, treatment time, and improve accuracy, intraoperative radiation therapy was used as definitive treatment or as a boost. The study's objective was to compare the short-term toxicity and cosmesis of single-fraction (SF) IORT and hypofractionated radiotherapy with IORT boost (HfB) given as definitive treatment. Between March 2011 and December 2013, 57 patients aged?45-91?years and 24 patients aged 43-83?years (total n = 81) with Stage 0-II were treated with SF or HfB (Mobetron, IntraOp Medical, Sunnyvale, CA). For SF treatment, 21?Gy was delivered using 4.5-6 cm applicators with electron energies from 6 to 12?MeV. For HfB, an intraoperative boost of 10?Gy was delivered using 4-7 cm applicators with energies from 4 to 12?MeV followed by whole-breast radiation with 40.5?Gy over 15 fractions. Toxicity was assessed at 2?weeks, 6?months, and 12?months per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute skin toxicity criteria and cosmesis. At 12?months, SF and HfB were well tolerated by all patients with no Grade 3+?toxicity. At 1?year, Grade-2 toxicity was resolved. Ninety-eight percent of SF patients and ninety percent of HfB patients had 0-1 grade toxicity. In the SF and HfB groups, 100% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis at 12-month followup interval. The SF exhibited a more favorable cosmesis with a higher percentage of excellent scores compared with HfB (80.4% vs. 45%; p?= 0.0033).

29032291,"Considering the increased fracture risk in early breast cancer patients treated with aromatase inhibitors (AI), we assessed the impact of a preventive intervention conducted by a specialized osteoporosis unit on bone health at AI treatment start. Retrospective cohort of postmenopausal women who started treatment with AI after breast cancer surgical/chemotherapy treatment and were referred to the osteoporosis unit for a comprehensive assessment of bone health. Bone densitometry and fracture screening by plain X-ray were performed at the baseline visit and once a year for 5 years. The final record included 130 patients. At AI treatment start, 49% had at least one high-risk factor for fractures, 55% had osteopenia, and 39% osteoporosis. Based on the baseline assessment, 79% of patients initiated treatment with bisphosphonates, 88% with calcium, and 79% with vitamin D. After a median of 65 (50-77) months, 4% developed osteopenia or osteoporosis, and 14% improved their densitometric diagnosis. Fifteen fractures were recorded in 11 (8.5%) patients, all of them receiving preventive treatment (10 with bisphosphonates). During the follow-up period, patients with one or more high-risk factors for fracture showed a greater frequency of fractures (15% vs. 3%) and experienced the first fracture earlier than those without high-risk factors (mean of 99 and 102 months, respectively; P=0.023). The preventive intervention of a specialized unit at the start of AI treatment in breast cancer survivors allows the identification of patients with high fracture risk and may contribute to preventing bone events in these patients.",breast_neoplasms

The analysis was carried out using a cross-sectional predictive study. Approximately half of those in the sample suffered from clinically significant emotional distress. The predictor variables selected explained a high percentage of the variability in emotional problems and quality of life (51.10-77.10%). Avoidance explained a high percentage of the variance in anxiety, depression and general distress. A lower degree of participation in valuable activities contributed, more specifically, to explaining variability in depression. The quantity and availability of environmental reinforcement was closely related to quality of life. A decisive contribution towards promoting emotional well-being and quality of life can be made by nursing action aimed at diminishing those avoidance strategies related to the oncological experience which may distance patients from daily activities which are gratifying and congruent with their values.",breast_neoplasms
29029991,"Interpretation of screening tests such as mammograms usually require a radiologist's subjective visual assessment of images, often resulting in substantial discrepancies between radiologists' classifications of subjects' test results. In clinical screening studies to assess the strength of agreement between experts, multiple raters are often recruited to assess subjects' test results using an ordinal classification scale. However, using traditional measures of agreement in some studies is challenging because of the presence of many raters, the use of an ordinal classification scale, and unbalanced data. We assess and compare the performances of existing measures of agreement and association as well as a newly developed model-based measure of agreement to three large-scale clinical screening studies involving many raters' ordinal classifications. We also conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the key properties of the summary measures. The assessment of agreement and association varied according to the choice of summary measure. Some measures were influenced by the underlying prevalence of disease and raters' marginal distributions and/or were limited in use to balanced data sets where every rater classifies every subject. Our simulation study indicated that popular measures of agreement and association are prone to underlying disease prevalence. Model-based measures provide a flexible approach for calculating agreement and association and are robust to missing and unbalanced data as well as the underlying disease prevalence.",breast_neoplasms
29029640,"This is a retrospective cross sectional study aimed to verify whether Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), a quantitative molecular assay, may represent a valuable reflex test in breast cancer with equivocal HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry and HER2 gene signals/nucleus (s/n) ranging between 4.0 and 5.9 by in situ hybridization. A series of 170 breast carcinomas scored as 2+ for HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry, were selected from our files and analyzed in parallel by silver in situ hybridization and by MLPA. According to ASCO-CAP 2013 guidelines, 54/170 tumors, displaying 4.0-5.9 HER2 gene s/n, were defined as low amplified (ratio?e?2) or equivocal (ratio?<?2) on the basis of centromere enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) status. An independent set of 108 score 2+ breast cancers represented the external validation set. Concordance between the two techniques was assessed through the use of Cohen's K statistic. A concordance rate of 78.2% (Cohen's K statistic: 0,548 95% CI:[0,419-0,677]) between in situ hybridization and MLPA was found in the whole series of 170 cases and of 55.5% (Cohen's K statistic: -0,043 95% CI:[-0,271-0,184]) in the 54 tumors presenting 4.0-5.9 HER2 gene s/n.

29028222,"Despite the benefit of endocrine therapy, acquired resistance during or after treatment still remains a major challenge in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We investigated the potential role of histone demethylase retinoblastoma-binding protein 2 (RBP2) in endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer. Survival of breast cancer patients according to RBP2 expression was analyzed in three different breast cancer cohorts including METABRIC (n?=?1980) and KM plotter (n?=?1764). RBP2-mediated tamoxifen resistance was confirmed by invitro sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric, colony-forming assays, and invivo xenograft models (n?=?8 per group). RNA-seq analysis and receptor tyrosine kinase assay were performed to identify the tamoxifen resistance mechanism by RBP2. All statistical tests were two-sided. RBP2 was associated with poor prognosis to tamoxifen therapy in ER-positive breast cancer (P = .04 in HYU cohort, P = .02 in KM plotter, P = .007 in METABRIC, log-rank test). Furthermore, RBP2 expression was elevated in patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer (P = .04, chi-square test). Knockdown of RBP2 conferred tamoxifen sensitivity, whereas overexpression of RBP2 induced tamoxifen resistance invitro and invivo (MCF7 xenograft: tamoxifen-treated control, mean [SD] tumor volume?=?70.8?[27.9] mm3, vs tamoxifen-treated RBP2, mean [SD] tumor volume?=?387.9?[85.1] mm3, P < .001). Mechanistically, RBP2 cooperated with ER co-activators and corepressors and regulated several tamoxifen resistance-associated genes, including NRIP1, CCND1, and IGFBP4 and IGFBP5. Furthermore, epigenetic silencing of IGFBP4/5 by RBP2-ER-NRIP1-HDAC1 complex led to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) activation. RBP2 also increased IGF1R-ErbB crosstalk and subsequent PI3K-AKT activation via demethylase activity-independent ErbB protein stabilization. Combinational treatment with tamoxifen and PI3K inhibitor could overcome RBP2-mediated tamoxifen resistance (RBP2-overexpressing cells: % cell viability [SD], tamoxifen = 89.0 [3.8]%, vs tamoxifen with BKM120 = 41.3 [5.6]%, P < .001). RBP2 activates ER-IGF1R-ErbB signaling cascade in multiple ways to induce tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that RBP2 is a potential therapeutic target for ER-driven cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Five ER/PR/HER2 subtypes were defined. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to examine ethnic disparities in breast cancer-specific survival. Of the 9,015 women, 891 were M?ori, 548 were Pacific and 7,576 others. Both M?ori and Pacific women were less likely to have triple negative breast cancer compared to others (8.6, 8.9 vs. 13.0%). Pacific women were more than twice as likely to have ER-, PR- and HER2+ cancer than M?ori and others (14.2 vs. 6.0%, 6.7%). After adjustment for age, year of diagnosis, stage, grade and treatment, the hazard ratios of breast cancer-specific mortality for M?ori and Pacific women with ER+, PR+ and HER2- were 1.52 (95% CI 1.06-2.18) and 1.55 (95% CI 1.04-2.31) compared to others, respectively. M?ori women with HER2+ cancer were twice more likely to die of their cancer than others.

We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals with breast, lung or colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Side effects were identified by patient self-report. The frequency, prevalence and incidence rates of side effects were calculated by cancer type and grade, and cumulative incidence curves for each side effect computed. Frequencies of side effects were compared between demographic subgroups using chi-squared statistics. Side effect data were available for 449 eligible individuals, who had a median follow-up of 5.64 months. 86% of participants reported at least one side effect during the study period and 27% reported a grade IV side effect, most commonly fatigue or dyspnoea. Fatigue was the most common side effect overall (85%), followed by diarrhoea (74%) and constipation (74%). Prevalence and incidence rates were similar across side effects and cancer types. Age was the only demographic factor associated with the incidence of side effects, with older people less likely to report side effects.

We included published original, non-pilot, studies that assess the effect of DAs for breast cancer screening. We excluded the studies that evaluated only participation intention or actual uptake. The studies' risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for RCTs and the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for non-RCTs. The main outcome measures were informed choice, decisional conflict and/or confidence, and knowledge. Secondary outcomes were values, attitudes, uncertainty and intention to be screened.

The use of DAs increased the proportion of women making an informed decision by 14%, 95% CI (2% to 27%) and the proportion of women with adequate knowledge by 12%, 95% CI (7% to 16%). We observed heterogeneity among the studies in confidence in the decision. The meta-analysis of the RCTs showed a significant decrease in confidence in the decision and in intention to be screened. Tools to aid decision making in screening for breast cancer improve knowledge and promote informed decision; however, we found divergent results on decisional conflict and confidence in the decision.

28987705,"The aim of this study is the evaluation of inter-observer variability in the measurement of liver metastases according to RECIST and its influence on response classification. A total of 100 radiologists measured liver target lesions, on pre- and post-chemotherapy CT scans of three patients. Each observer filled out a questionnaire about his personal and work features. The evaluations of a well experienced radiologist, considered as ""the gold standard"", were compared to those taken by the observers. The percentage of the observers in agreement with the reviewer, in terms of the response category and in terms of inter-observer variability, was calculated for each patient. The percentage of the inter-observer agreement was elevated. Most of the observers in agreement with the reviewer were senior radiologists, while those who disagreed were junior radiologist, but this result did not reach a statistical significance. More than 30% of observers disagreed with the reviewer at least in one of the three cases. RECIST measurements are reproducible on a large and heterogeneous population of radiologists. Age and expertise of the radiologist remain the most critical factors: this suggests a revision by well-experienced radiologists in clinical trials.",breast_neoplasms
28987687,"Incidental hepatic lesions identified on breast MR can be a diagnostic dilemma due to concern for liver metastases or other significant hepatic lesions. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence and nature of liver lesions seen on breast MR, and determine if additional imaging is necessary. Imaging reports of all breast MR examinations performed at our institution from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 were reviewed to identify reports with hepatic abnormalities. Lesion characteristics, subsequent diagnosis, duration of follow up and additional imaging results (if performed) were all recorded. Of 1664 breast MRs, incidental hepatic lesions were seen in 207 studies (12.4%) in 169 patients. In 154 of 169 patients (91.1%) the lesions were characterized as T2 hyperintense and clearly as bright as adjacent fat on T2-weighted or localizer sequences. 0 of these 154 lesions were clinically significant at clinical or radiological follow-up. In the remaining 8.9% (15 of 169), lesions were characterized as not as bright as adjacent fat on T2 weighted or localizer imaging. In two cases, lesions were confirmed as incidental hepatic metastatic disease. 91.1% of incidental hepatic lesions were circumscribed, T2 hyperintense lesions and characterised as clearly as bright as adjacent fat on T2 weighted imaging at additional review. None of which were clinically significant at clinical or radiological follow-up. We advocate that circumscribed T2 hyperintense lesions which are clearly as bright as adjacent fat on T2 weighted imaging are of unlikely clinical significance and follow-up imaging should not be recommended, reducing the rate of additional imaging from 37.3% to 5.3%.",breast_neoplasms

From March 10th to September 22th, 2014, we retrospectively included a total of 70 consecutive patients with 106 histologically proven lesions (58 malignant and 48 benign) who underwent breast MR imaging for preoperative breast staging (n=38), high-risk screening (n=7), problem solving (n=18), and nipple discharge (n=4) with 12 time resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) acquisitions during contrast inflow interleaved in a regular high-resolution dynamic MRI protocol (FULL protocol). Two readers scored MR exams as either positive or negative and described significant lesions according to Bi-RADS lexicon with a TRICKS images (ULTRAFAST), an abbreviated protocol (FAST) and all images (FULL protocol). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were calculated for each protocol and compared with McNemar's test. For all readers, the combined FAST-ULTRAFAST protocol significantly improved the reading with a specificity of 83.3% and 70.8% in comparison with FAST protocol or FULL protocol, respectively, without change in sensitivity. By adding ULTRAFAST protocol to FAST protocol, readers 1 and 2 were able to correctly change the diagnosis in 22.9% (11/48) and 10.4% (5/48) of benign lesions, without missing any malignancy, respectively. Both interpretation and image acquisition times for combined FAST-ULTRAFAST protocol and FAST protocol were shorter compared to FULL protocol (p<0.001). Compared to FULL protocol, adding ULTRAFAST to FAST protocol improves specificity, mainly in correctly reclassifying benign masses and reducing interpretation and acquisition time, without decreasing sensitivity.",breast_neoplasms
28986734,"Oocyte and/or embryo cryopreservation after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) represents the most established method for female fertility preservation (FP) before cancer treatment. Whether patients suffering from malignancies, candidates for FP, have a normal ovarian capacity to respond to stimulation is controversial. Reduced responsiveness of antral follicle to exogenous FSH might be at play. The percentage of antral follicles that successfully respond to FSH administration may be estimated by the follicular output rate (FORT), which presumably reflects the health of granulosa cells. The present study aims at investigating whether the FORT differs between Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and breast cancer (BC) patients. Forty-nine BC and 33 HL patient candidates for FP using oocyte vitrification following COH were prospectively studied. FORT was calculated by the ratio between the pre-ovulatory follicle count (16-22?mm) on the day of oocyte triggering ???100/antral follicle count before initiation of the stimulation. Overall, women in the HL group were younger in comparison with BC patients (26.4????3.9 vs 33.6????3.3?years, p?<?0.0001, respectively). The FORT was significantly decreased in patients with HL when compared with BC group (27.0????18.8 vs 39.8????18.9%, p?=?0.004, respectively), further leading to a comparable number of oocytes vitrified (10.8????5.9 vs 10.2????7.7 oocytes, p?=?0.7, respectively). The present findings indicate that the percentage of antral follicles that successfully respond to FSH administration is reduced in HL when compared to BC patients, supporting the hypothesis of a detrimental effect of hemopathy on follicul",breast_neoplasms

The impact of the timing of PMRT to a tissue expander or permanent implant is not well understood. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate outcomes in implant-based reconstruction and the timing of PMRT. 2) were calculated on meta-analysis. There were 20 studies meeting inclusion criteria with 2348 patients identified. Pooled analysis revealed an overall rate of reconstructive failure of 17.6% and Baker grade III/IV capsular contracture of 37.5%. PMRT applied to tissue expanders resulted in higher rates of reconstructive failure compared with PMRT applied to permanent silicone implants (20% versus 13.4%, RR?=?2.33, P?=?0.0083, 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.35), but lower rates of capsular contracture (24.5% versus 49.4%, RR?=?0.53, P?=?0.083, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.09). Regardless of timing, PMRT applied to implant-based breast reconstruction was associated with high risk of reconstructive failure and capsular contracture.

28984771,"Although rare, occult breast cancer (OBC) originates from breast tissue. Its primary lesions cannot be identified by clinical examination or imaging; therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis remain controversial. This study comprised 5 female OBC patients who were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for painless axillary lumps. F-flurodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) indicated metastasis in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. No clear breast primary lesions were identified; other organs were also excluded as the primary site. Pathological biopsy confirmed axillary lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor to identify the source revealed that estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PgRs) were positive in 2 cases, ER was positive and PR was negative in 1 case, and both were negative in 2 cases. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was negative in all cases. All patients were diagnosed with OBC. All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). One patient did not undergo follow-up therapy. The other 4 underwent total mastectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Two patients also underwent endocrine therapy. Patients were followed up for 9.0 to 72.0 months. Four achieved pathological complete response. One patient experienced metastasis to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes 2.0 years later, which was cleared after additional treatment. The other patients were tumor free. Here, we are reporting 5 cases of OBC treated with NAC that were evaluated by F-FDG PET/CT scans. This study suggests that NAC might lead to a positive outcome.",breast_neoplasms
28984209,"With the advances in high-throughput gene profiling technologies, a large volume of gene interaction maps has been constructed. A higher-level layer of gene-gene interaction, namely modulate gene interaction, is composed of gene pairs of which interaction strengths are modulated by (i.e., dependent on) the expression level of a key modulator gene. Systematic investigations into the modulation by estrogen receptor (ER), the best-known modulator gene, have revealed the functional and prognostic significance in breast cancer. However, a genome-wide identification of key modulator genes that may further unveil the landscape of modulated gene interaction is still lacking. We proposed a systematic workflow to screen for key modulators based on genome-wide gene expression profiles. We designed four modularity parameters to measure the ability of a putative modulator to perturb gene interaction networks. Applying the method to a dataset of 286 breast tumors, we comprehensively characterized the modularity parameters and identified a total of 973 key modulator genes. The modularity of these modulators was verified in three independent breast cancer datasets. ESR1, the encoding gene of ER, appeared in the list, and abundant novel modulators were illuminated. For instance, a prognostic predictor of breast cancer, SFRP1, was found the second modulator. Functional annotation analysis of the 973 modulators revealed involvements in ER-related cellular processes as well as immune- and tumor-associated functions. Here we present, as far as we know, the first comprehensive analysis of key modulator genes on a genome-wide scale. The validity of filtering parameters as well as the conservativity of modulators among cohorts were corroborated. Our data bring new insights into the modulated layer of gene-gene interaction and provide candidates for further biological investigations.",breast_neoplasms

Lung cancer with breast cancer was observed in 14 patients (1.3% of breast cancer and 2.1% of lung cancer cases; mean age=65 years), and 3/14 (21.4%) patients were smokers. Sixteen lung cancer lesions in 14 patients were adenocarcinomas and one was squamous cell carcinoma. All 14 patients were alive at the time of this report; 4/14 (28.6%) patients had recurrent breast cancer and 1/14 (7.1%) had recurrent lung cancer. In synchronous cases, 5/6 (83.3%) patients received concomitant surgery for both breast cancer and lung cancer. Patients' postoperative courses were uneventful. In metachronous cases, eight patients had lung cancer a mean of 33 months after breast cancer surgery. All eight patients received adjuvant therapies and 4/8 (50%) patients received adjuvant therapies for recurrent breast cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and anti-HER2 therapy. All patients had early-stage lung adenocarcinoma and underwent surgical resection. Concomitant surgery for synchronous lung and breast cancer was feasible and safe. In metachronous cases, lung cancers tended to be detected within 3 years after surgery for breast cancer. Careful follow-up for postoperative breast cancer may contribute to the detection of early-stage lung cancer.",breast_neoplasms

The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). The secondary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. The full analysis set comprised of 37 patients receiving NG and 37 receiving NP. The DCR was 70.3% with NG and 64.9% with NP (p=0.619). Median PFS were 7 months (95% CI=5.88-8.12) and 6 months (95% CI=5.29-6.71) respectively in NG and NP group [hazard ratio (HR)=1.696; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.73-3.93; p=0.217)].

Groups of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with: no small interfering RNA (siRNA); siRNA with no target; S1P1-silencing siRNA; S1P3-silencing siRNA; and siRNAs silencing both S1P1, and S1P3 were examined for this purpose at 24, 48 and 72 h after intervention. Viability of cells was reduced due to suppression of S1P1/S1P3. While no change was observed in the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, the proliferation of S1P1/S1P3-suppressed MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced. S1P1/S1P3 suppression resulted in reduction of adhesion of MCF-7 cells, but to an increase of MDA-MB-231 cells. Lateral motility was reduced in all S1P1/S1P3-suppressed groups.

In this cross-sectional study, structured-questionnaires were distributed among breast cancer survivors in 19 hospitals. QoL was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the breast cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-BR23). QoC is indicated by adherence to the core measures stipulated for the treatment of breast cancer. Multiple regression and hierarchical linear modeling were used for multivariate analysis. A total of 544 female survivors of Stage 0-III breast cancer were included, among whom 217 (39.9%) underwent BCT and 327 (60.1%) underwent mastectomy. Surgical modality does not appear to have a notable impact on any QoL domains except body image; i.e. patients who underwent BCT reported better body image (diff = 11.20, P < 0.001), particularly at 1-5 years after the initial treatment. Independent factors including age, education, employment, marital status, income, chemotherapy, duration since treatment, recurrence status, primary hospital accreditation level and location all appear to be correlated to QoL.

28980126,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase PRL-3 plays an important role in cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. In breast cancer, PRL-3 is overexpressed in 70-75% of tumors and even more frequently in lymph node metastases. Moreover, PRL-3 overexpression in breast cancer is associated with an adverse disease outcome. Aim of this study was to determine the role of PRL-3 in breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. PRL-3 mRNA expression was evaluated in 6 breast cancer cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR. To investigate the effect of PRL-3 expression in breast cancer cells in vitro we both up- and downregulated PRL-3 expression in breast cancer cells and performed in vitro wound repair cell motility assays and invasion assays. The influence of PRL-3 knockdown in MCF-7 cells on the expression of several gene products involved in cell invasion and cytoskeletal function was evaluated with real-time PCR. PRL-3 mRNA expression was demonstrated in all breast cancer cell lines evaluated. Knockdown of PRL-3 in MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased proliferation, wound healing and invasion. PRL-3 knockdown in MCF-7 cells resulted in a significant reduction of heparanase, MMP-9, actin gamma-2 and Myosin 9 expression, and significant elevation of E-cadherin. We conclude that PRL-3 is an important regulatory factor for breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Loss of PRL-3 function induces an antimetastatic gene expression profile in breast cancer cells. Due to its role in tumor growth and metastasis, PRL-3 emerges as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer therapy.",breast_neoplasms

From February, 2011 to December, 2012, 1,495 breast specimens were registered, and 1,310 samples collected at 24 centers were analyzed. Median patient age was 54 years, and the majority of samples were obtained from segmental (46.9%) or radical mastectomy (34.4%). The predominant histological type was invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (85%), 64.3% had tubule formation (grade 3), and estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) were positive in 77.4/67.8% of the specimens analyzed, respectively. Using IHC, we found a negative HER-2 status (0 or 1+) in 72.2% of specimens, and 3+ in 18.5%; the 9.3% scored as 2+ were further analyzed by ISH, of which 15.7% were positive (thus, 20.0% of samples were HER-2- -positive by either method). We found no association between HER-2 scores and menopausal status or histological type. Tumors classified as 3+ came from younger patients, and had higher histological grade and less frequent expression of ER/PR. In the North region of Brazil, 34.7% of samples were 3+, with lower frequencies in the other four regions of the country.

28970856,"We evaluated the concordance between core needle biopsy (CNB) and surgical specimens on examining intrinsic biological subtypes and receptor status, and determined the accuracy of CNB as a basic diagnostic method. We analyzed breast cancer patients with paired CNB and surgical specimen samples during 2014. We used monoclonal antibodies for nuclear staining, and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status evaluation. A positive test was defined as staining greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was graded by immunohistochemistry and scored as 0 to 3+ according to the recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists. Ki-67 immunostaining was performed using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, and the results were divided at 10% intervals. The cutoff value for high Ki-67 was defined as 20%. Concordance analysis of ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, and five intrinsic biological subtypes was performed on CNB and surgical specimens. Statistical analysis for concordance was calculated using ??-tests. We found very good agreement for ER and PR with a concordance of 96.7% for ER (??=0.903), and 94.3% for PR (??=0.870). HER2 and Ki-67 showed concordance rates of 84.8% (??=0.684) and 83.5% (??=0.647), respectively, which were interpreted as good agreement. Five subgroups analysis showed 85.8% agreement and ??-value of 0.786, also indicating good agreement. CNB showed high diagnostic accuracy compared with surgical specimens, and good agreement for ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67. Our findings reaffirmed the recommendation of CNB as an initial procedure for breast cancer diagnosis, and the assessment of receptor status and intrinsic biological subtypes to determine further treatment plans.",breast_neoplasms

Serious side effects include hypertension, proteinuria, bowel perforation, and thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in hypertension-associated genes is associated with bevacizumab-induced hypertension (BIH). Patients with solid tumors treated with bevacizumab in combination with other therapy were identified from six clinical trials. Haplotype-tagging (ht) SNPs for 10 candidate genes associated with hypertension were identified through the International Hapmap Project. Germline DNA was genotyped for 103 htSNPs using mass spectrometry. Bevacizumab toxicities were identified from clinical trial reports. Haplotypes were reconstructed from diploid genotyping data and frequencies were compared using standard two-sided statistical tests. The study included 114 patients with breast, lung, ovarian, or other cancers, of whom 38 developed BIH. WNK1, KLKB1, and GRK4 were found to contain single loci associated with BIH. Haplotype analysis of WNK1, KLKB1, and GRK4 identified risk haplotypes in each gene associated with grade 3/4 BIH. A composite risk model was created based on these haplotypes. Patients with the highest risk score were the most likely to develop grade 3/4 BIH (OR=6.45; P=0.005; 95%CI, 1.86-22.39). We concluded that genetic variation in WNK1, KLKB1, and GRK4 may be associated with BIH. These genes are biologically plausible mediators due to their role in blood pressure control, regulating sodium homeostasis and vascular tone. This preliminary risk model performed better than population-based risk models and when further validated may help risk-stratify patients for BIH prior to initiating therapy.",breast_neoplasms

A systematic review of observational studies on the association of isoflavone biomarkers with the risk of chronic disease and mortality was conducted. Meta-analyses of specific biomarker and disease combinations were performed. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched. Two authors screened the titles and abstracts of candidate publications. The third author was consulted to resolve discrepancies. Forty studies were included and their quality assessed. PRISMA-P guidelines were followed. Eight different isoflavone biomarkers were investigated in association with cancer (26 studies), mortality (2 studies), cardiovascular disease (3 studies), metabolic syndrome risk factors (7 studies), and other outcomes (2 studies). Meta-analyses of studies on individual isoflavonic compounds were conducted for breast and prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes. Higher daidzein and genistein concentrations were associated with lower risk of breast cancer and diabetes. Only daidzein concentrations were inversely associated with risk of prostate cancer. For the remaining endpoints, evidence for associations was inconsistent and scarce, perhaps owing to heterogeneity in study exposures and outcomes.

28969357,"The investigation of dose-response associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and risk of breast cancer stratified by menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and body mass index (BMI) remains inconclusive. A systematic review and dose-response meta-analyses was conducted to investigate these associations. As part of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Continuous Update Project, PubMed was searched up to May 2015 for relevant studies on these associations. Prospective studies reporting associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer risk were included. Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Random-effects models were used to summarize relative risks (RRs) and 95%CIs. Heterogeneity between subgroups, including menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and BMI was explored using meta-regression. Nineteen publications were included. The summary RRs (95%CIs) for breast cancer were 1.04 (1.00-1.07) per 10 units/d for glycemic index, 1.01 (0.98-1.04) per 50 units/d for glycemic load, and 1.00 (0.96-1.05) per 50?g/d for carbohydrate intake. For glycemic index, the association appeared slightly stronger among postmenopausal women (summary RR per 10 units/d, 1.06; 95%CI, 1.02-1.10) than among premenopausal women, though the difference was not statistically significant (Pheterogeneity?=?0.15). Glycemic load and carbohydrate intake were positively associated with breast cancer among postmenopausal women with estrogen-negative tumors (summary RR for glycemic load, 1.28; 95%CI, 1.08-1.52; and summary RR for carbohydrates, 1.13; 95%CI, 1.02-1.25).

28968753,"Identification of disease-associated miRNAs (disease miRNAs) is critical for understanding disease etiology and pathogenesis. Since miRNAs exert their functions by regulating the expression of their target mRNAs, several methods based on the target genes were proposed to predict disease miRNA candidates. They achieved only limited success as they all suffered from the high false-positive rate of target prediction results. Alternatively, other prediction methods were based on the observation that miRNAs with similar functions tend to be associated with similar diseases and vice versa. The methods exploited the information about miRNAs and diseases, including the functional similarities between miRNAs, the similarities between diseases, and the associations between miRNAs and diseases. However, how to integrate the multiple kinds of information completely and consider the biological characteristic of disease miRNAs is a challenging problem. We constructed a bilayer network to represent the complex relationships among miRNAs, among diseases and between miRNAs and diseases. We proposed a non-negative matrix factorization based method to rank, so as to predict, the disease miRNA candidates. The method integrated the miRNA functional similarity, the disease similarity, and the miRNA-disease associations seamlessly, which exploited the complex relationships within the bilayer network and the consensus relationship between multiple kinds of information. Considering the correlation between the candidates related to various diseases, it predicted their respective candidates for all the diseases simultaneously. In addition, the sparseness characteristic of disease miRNAs was introduced to generate more reliable prediction model that excludes those noisy candidates. The results on 15 common diseases showed a superior performance of the new method for not only well-characterized diseases but also new ones. A detailed case study on breast neoplasms, colorectal neoplasms, lung neoplasms, and 32 other diseases demonstrated the ability of the method for discovering potential disease miRNAs.

We sought to investigate the levels and determinants of breast cancer screening (BCS) and cervical cancer screening (CCS) in HIV-infected women as compared with the general population. The Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida et les H?patites Virales (ANRS)-Vespa2 study was conducted in 2011 in a national representative sample of 3022 HIV-infected hospital out-patients in France. The rates and correlates of BCS and CCS among HIV-infected women were compared with those in the general population using multivariate Poisson regression models. The BCS rate during the 2?years preceding the survey interview was 80.7% among HIV-infected women vs. 89.1% in the general population (P?=?0.146). The CCS rate during the preceding 3?years was 88.1% among HIV-infected women vs. 83.1% in the general population (P?=?0.021).

We used a Markov model to simulate cost-effectiveness, disease progression, and survival, based on clinical data and transition probabilities extracted from the CLEOPATRA study. Direct medical costs were acquired from the NHIB claims database.The utilities in health state were based on a recent cost-effectiveness study on trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in New Taiwan dollars (NT$), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of specific parameters on the model. Modeled median survival was 39.1?months for TD and 50.1?months for TDP. The ICER was NT$18,999,687 (US$593,741) per QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses indicated that TDP could be cost-effective under favorable assumptions; TDP had a 68% chance of being cost-effective, if TDP costs could be reduced with 10% in the stable disease state.

The present analysis focuses on 4357 breast cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 and within 18?months of a screening mammogram (N?= 714,218). We used logistic regression with model-based standardization (predictive margins) to estimate adjusted prevalence differences corresponding to a racial disparity in IBC. Overall, prevalence of IBC within 18?months was 20.7%. Contrary to expectation, in patient-adjusted models, there was no IBC racial disparity (percentage point disparity?=?-2.1, 95% confidence interval:?-4.7, 2.6). However, when controlling for facility characteristics, including proportion of nL black patients, the model coefficient for the IBC disparity reversed sign and changed substantially (P?<?.0001) and a racial disparity emerged (percentage point disparity?=?+5.1, 95% confidence interval:?-0.3, 9.9).

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of organized screening compared with opportunistic screening, as well as to identify factors influencing the clinical and economic outcomes. We developed and validated an individual-level state-transition model and assessed the health outcomes and costs of organized and opportunistic screening for 40-year-old asymptomatic women. The base-case analysis compared a scenario involving organized biennial screening with a scenario reflecting opportunistic screening practice for an average-risk woman aged 45 to 69 years. We applied an annual discount rate of 3% and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of the cost (2012 euros) per life-year gained (LYG) from a health care perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. Compared with opportunistic screening, an organized program yielded on average additional 0.0118 undiscounted life-years (i.e., 4.3 days) and cost savings of ??41 per woman. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of organized screening was approximately ??20,000 per LYG compared with no screening. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of ??50,000 per LYG, there was a 70% probability that organized screening would be considered cost-effective. The attendance rate, but not the test accuracy of mammography, was an influential factor for the cost-effectiveness. The decision to adopt organized screening is likely an efficient use of limited health care resources in Austria.",breast_neoplasms

This study aimed to determine in patients where conventional prognostic markers did not provide a clear recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy, whether Ki67 could be a substitute for RS. We reviewed all cases of luminal-type node-negative early breast cancer (T1-2, N0-1mi, M0, estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative) referred for Oncotype DX testing by the multidisciplinary team at an Australian tertiary private hospital from 14th December 2006 to 31st December 2013, when conventional prognostic markers did not provide a clear recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy. RS was correlated with Ki67, along with other conventional prognostic markers including tumor size, grade, mitotic rate and lymphovascular invasion. Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) were used for ordinal and continuous variables, respectively. A total of 58 patients were analyzed, median Ki67 was 15% (range 2-50%) and the median RS was 16 (range 3-65). There was no positive correlation between Ki67 and RS (r?=?0.01, P?=?0.93).

Ki67 and conventional prognostic markers do not correlate with Oncotype DX RS. In the setting where conventional prognostic markers do not show a clear indication for or against adjuvant chemotherapy as determined by consensus in a multidisciplinary team, Ki67 is not a substitute for Oncotype DX testing.

However, the role of AR in breast cancers is still not fully elucidated and the biology of AR in breast cancer remains incompletely understood. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can serve as prognostic and diagnostic tools, prompting us to measure AR protein expression and conduct genomic analyses on CTCs in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Blood samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer were deposited on glass slides, subjected to nuclear staining with DAPI, and reacted with fluorescent-labeled antibodies to detect CD45, cytokeratin (CK), and biomarkers of interest (AR, estrogen receptor [ER], and HER2) on all nucleated cells. The stained slides were scanned and enumerated by non-enrichment-based non-biased approach independent of cell surface epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) using the Epic Sciences CTC platform. Data were analyzed using established digital pathology algorithms. Of 68 patients, 51 (75%) had at least 1 CTC, and 49 of these 51 (96%) had hormone-receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative primary tumors. AR was expressed in CK+ CTCs in 10 patients. Of these 10 patients, 3 also had ER expression in CK+ CTCs. Single cell genomic analysis of 78 CTCs from 1 of these 3 patients identified three distinct copy number patterns. AR+ cells had a lower frequency of chromosomal changes than ER+ and HER2+ cells. CTC enumeration and analysis using no enrichment or selection provides a non-biased approach to detect AR expression and chromosomal aberrations in CTCs in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The heterogeneity of intrapatient AR expression in CTCs leads to the new hypothesis that patients with AR+ CTCs have heterogeneous disease with multiple drivers.

Patient characteristics and outcomes between irradiated and unirradiated patients were analyzed using ttests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Multivariable mixed-effects regression modelsassessed the impact of reconstruction type and radiotherapy on outcomes after adjusting for relevant covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided. Autologous reconstruction was more commonly received by irradiated patients (37.9% vs 25.0%, P < .001). Immediate reconstruction was less common in irradiated patients (83.0% vs 95.7%, P < .001). At least one breast complication had occurred by two years in 38.9% of irradiated patients with implant reconstruction, 25.6% of irradiated patients with autologous reconstruction, 21.8% of unirradiated patients with implant reconstruction, and 28.3% of unirradiated patients with autologous reconstruction. Multivariable analysis showed bilateral treatment and higher body mass index to be predictive of developing a complication, with a statistically significant interaction between radiotherapy receipt and reconstruction type. Among irradiated patients, autologous reconstruction was associated with a lower risk of complications than implant-based reconstruction at two years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27 to 0.82, P = .007); no between-procedure difference was found in unirradiated patients.

Information was recorded for referrals, biopsy rates and pathological diagnoses. Intra & inter-group comparisons were performed. 1646 patients were included. An increase of 25.2%(n?=?184) was observed in referrals in 2014(n?=?915) compared to 2013(n?=?731). Cancer detection rates went down significantly (P?=?0.002,Chi-square) in 2014 (5.1%,n?=?47) compared to 2013 (9.0%,n?=?66) due to the increase in number of referrals. In the over 70s group, a higher than predicted increase of 64.2%(n?=?52) in all referrals, and 8%(n?=?44) in two-week wait referrals was observed. The number of biopsies and cancers detected remained stable although the proportions undergoing biopsies (2014-29.3%,n?=?39/133 versus 2013-38.3%,n?=?31/81) or being diagnosed with cancer (2014-19.5%,n?=?26/133 versus 2013-30.9%,n?=?25/81) declined significantly (P?=?0.001,McNemar) during the campaign due to an inflation in the number of referrals. Despite the overall reduction, cancer detection rate for biopsies performed remained significantly high in the over 70s (66.7%,n?=?26/39) when compared with the under 70s (23.9%,n?=?21/88) during the campaign. Although ""Be Clear on Cancer"" campaign resulted in a significant increase in breast cancer referrals, it did not translate into an increase in biopsy rates or cancer detection rates. The amount of work generated for the hospital because of this campaign was far greater than the predicted increase from campaign pilots. Therefore, the overall effectiveness of this campaign is questionable.",breast_neoplasms
28950350,"Intakes of specific fatty acids have been postulated to impact breast cancer risk but epidemiological data based on dietary questionnaires remain conflicting. We assessed the association between plasma phospholipid fatty acids and breast cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Sixty fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography in pre-diagnostic plasma phospholipids from 2982 incident breast cancer cases matched to 2982 controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risk of breast cancer by fatty acid level. The false discovery rate (q values) was computed to control for multiple comparisons. Subgroup analyses were carried out by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression in the tumours. A high level of palmitoleic acid [odds ratio (OR) for the highest quartile compared with the lowest OR (Q4-Q1) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.64; P for trend?=?0.0001, q value?=?0.004] as well as a high desaturation index (DI16) (16:1n-7/16:0) [OR (Q4-Q1), 1.28; 95% C, 1.07-1.54; P for trend?=?0.002, q value?=?0.037], as biomarkers of de novo lipogenesis, were significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Levels of industrial trans-fatty acids were positively associated with ER-negative tumours [OR for the highest tertile compared with the lowest (T3-T1)=2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.90; P for trend?=?0.047], whereas no association was found for ER-positive tumours (P-heterogeneity?=0.01). No significant association was found between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk, overall or by hormonal receptor. These findings suggest that increased de novo lipogenesis, acting through increased synthesis of palmitoleic acid, could be a relevant metabolic pathway for breast tumourigenesis.

28949967,"To establish a preoperative decision model for accurate indication of systemic therapy in early-stage breast cancer using multiparametric MRI at 7-tesla field strength. Patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10-year risk-estimates of breast cancer mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31-phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication from preoperatively available data. We included 46 women (age: 43-74yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43%) had positive, and 26 patients (57%) negative indication for systemic therapy. Using conventional workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive postoperative indication (N = 8/8; 100%). Negative preoperative indication was correct in only 26/38 (68%) patients. However, 31P-MRS score (p = 0.030) and tumor size (p = 0.002) were associated with the postoperative indication. The decision model shows that negative indication is correct in 21/22 (96%) patients when exempting tumors larger than 2.0cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at 31P-MRS. Preoperatively, positive indication for systemic therapy is highly accurate. Negative indication is highly accurate (96%) for tumors sized ??2,0cm on DCE-MRI and with PME??PDE ratios on 31P-MRS.",breast_neoplasms

The risk for the development of secondary malignant neoplasms might be significantly increased due to exposure of healthy tissue outside of the target field to secondary neutrons, in particular in proton therapy. Thus far, the radiobiological effects of these neutrons and a comparison with photons on normal breast cells have not been sufficiently characterised. n?>?= 70.5?MeV) produced by 190?MeV protons impinging on a water phantom, were analysed. The clonogenic survival and the DNA repair capacity were determined and values of relative biological effectiveness were compared. Furthermore, the influence of radiation on the sphere formation was observed to examine the radiation response of the potential fraction of stem like cells within the MCF10A cell population. X-rays and neutrons caused dose-dependent decreases of survival fractions after irradiations with up to 2?Gy. Monoenergetic neutrons with an energy of 0.56?MeV had a higher effectiveness on the survival fraction with respect to neutrons with higher energies and to the mixed gamma - secondary neutron field induced by proton interactions in water. Similar effects were observed for the DNA repair capacity after exposure to ionising radiation (IR). Both experimental endpoints provided comparable values of the relative biological effectiveness. Significant changes in the sphere formation were notable following the various radiation qualities. n?>?= 5.8?MeV), and to the mixed gamma - secondary neutron field given by interactions of 190?MeV protons in water.

28946143,"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs play a critical role in breast cancer (BC) progression. microRNA-101 (miR-101) has been considered a tumor suppressive miRNA in different cancer types. This study aimed to investigate miR-101 expression in BC tissues and to investigate its roles in BC progression that are mediated by Sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), a critical oncogene in various cancers. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect miR-101 and SOX2 expression in BC tissues and paired normal tissues or BC cell lines. MTT, transwell migration, wound healing, colony formation, flow cytometric and xenograft assays were performed to determine the influence of miR-101 and SOX2 on the malignant behaviors of BC cells in vitro and in vivo. miR-101 was significantly downregulated in BC tissues and cell lines. miR-101 overexpression inhibited the malignant behaviors of BC cells, both in vitro and in vivo. miR-101 downregulation had the converse effect. A miR-101 binding site was identified by luciferase reporter assay in the 3'UTR of SOX2. SOX2 was upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines, and its upregulation was associated with lymph node metastasis, pathological grade and TNM classification. SOX2 knockdown mimicked the effects of miR-101 overexpression on the malignant behaviors of BC cells, while SOX2 overexpression mitigated the miR-101-induced inhibition of these effects. Our study revealed that miR-101 plays a critical role in suppressing tumor progression by directly targeting SOX2.",breast_neoplasms

28945801,"Zoledronic acid (ZA) has antiresorptive effects and protects from bone metastasis in women with early breast cancer. In addition, in postmenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer ZA prolongs DFS. The exact mechanism is still unclear. We have therefore investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of ZA in breast cancer cell lines in the absence or presence of estradiol to mimic the hormonal environment in vitro. Using assays for cell proliferation (EZ4U, BrdU) and cell death (Annexin/PI), we have analyzed the dose-dependent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of ZA in two hormone sensitive cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) and a hormone insensitive, triple negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) in the presence of 0, 1 and 10 nM estradiol. In the absence of estradiol, ZA exerts dose-dependent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic antitumor effects in both, hormone sensitive (MCF-7, T47D) and -insensitive (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines (p<0.0001). In the presence of estradiol, the antitumoral effect of ZA was significantly decreased only in the hormone sensitive MCF-7 and T47D cell lines (p = 0.0008 and p = 0.0008, respectively). We have demonstrated that estradiol impairs the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of ZA in hormone sensitive, but not in hormone insensitive breast cancer cell lines. Our findings provide a possible explanation for the differential effect of ZA on DFS in pre- and postmenopausal patients with hormone sensitive early breast cancer, which has been demonstrated clinically. We further hypothesize that endocrine insensitive tumors such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) should benefit from ZA irrespective of their menopausal status.",breast_neoplasms
28944729,"The rise in pharmaceutical expenditures in recent years has increased health care payer interest in ensuring good value for the money. Indication-based pricing (IBP) sets separate, indication-specific prices paid to the manufacturer according to the expected efficacy of a drug in each of its indications. IBP allows payers to consistently pay for value across indications. While promising, a limitation of IBP as originally conceived is that efficacy estimates are typically based on clinical trial data, which may differ from real-world effectiveness. An outcomes guarantee is a type of performance-based risk-sharing arrangement that adjusts payments according to prospectively tracked outcomes. We suggest that an outcomes guarantee contract, which has been used by some payers, may be adapted to achieve indication-based prices supported by real-world effectiveness. To illustrate the potential of an outcomes guarantee to achieve indication-based prices aligned with real-world value, using a case study of trastuzumab for the treatment of metastatic breast and advanced gastric cancers. We estimated costs and outcomes under traditional IBP (i.e., expected value IBP) and outcomes guarantee frameworks and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing treatment with and without trastuzumab. Efficacy data came from pivotal trials, whereas effectiveness data came from observational studies. We adjusted trastuzumab prices in order to achieve target ICERs of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year under each framework and for each indication. To achieve the ICER target under traditional IBP, the unit price of trastuzumab using efficacy evidence was adjusted for metastatic breast and advanced gastric cancers from an average sales price of $9.17 per mg to $3.50 per mg and $0.93 per mg, respectively. Under an outcomes guarantee, the unit price of trastuzumab using effectiveness evidence was adjusted for metastatic breast cancer and advanced gastric cancer to $8.66 per mg and $0.20 per mg, respectively. Like expected value IBP, outcomes guarantee contracts can also vary payment based on indication. In addition, an outcomes guarantee can also reduce uncertainty regarding effectiveness and better align payment with the actual value of a treatment. No funding supported this study.

We evaluated additional findings caused by CESM alone and outweighed them against the disadvantages of this technique. From December 2012 to December 2015, all women recalled from screening who underwent CESM were considered for this study. Radiation exposure and number of adverse contrast reactions were analysed. An experienced breast radiologist reviewed all exams and identified cases with lesions detected by CESM alone and scored their conspicuity. From these cases, data on breast density and final diagnosis were collected. For malignant cases, tumour grade and receptor characteristics were also collected. During this study, 839 women underwent CESM after a screening recall, in which five minor adverse contrast reactions were observed. Median radiation dose per exam was 6.0mGy (0.9-23.4mGy). Seventy CESM-only lesions were detected in 65 patients. Of these 70 lesions, 54.3% proved to be malignant, most commonly invasive ductal carcinomas. The remaining CESM-only lesions were benign, predominantly fibroadenomas. No complications were observed during biopsy of these lesions. Retrospectively, the majority of the lesions were either occult or a 'minimal sign' on low-energy CESM images or the screening mammogram. Using CESM as a work-up tool for women recalled from screening carries low risk for the patient, while additionally detected tumour foci might hold important clinical implications which need to be further studied in large, randomized controlled trials.",breast_neoplasms

Logistic regressions were conducted to test elements from each model and to identify correlates of intentional and unintentional non-adherence. 2 ?=?17%). Intentional non-adherence was best explained by a combination of TPB and CSM variables, but these variables did not contribute significantly to unintentional non-adherence.

Elements from both models should be considered when designing interventions to increase adherence rates. Statement of contribution What is already known about this subject? Non-adherence to tamoxifen is common and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few modifiable predictors of tamoxifen non-adherence have been identified. What does this study add? Unintentional non-adherence is reported much more frequently than intentional non-adherence. Elements from the CSM and TPB provide a useful framework for understanding non-adherence to tamoxifen.

However, preclinical studies suggested that statins may influence mammary cancer growth, but the clinical evidence is still inconsistent.

For this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL for published studies up to January 31, 2017. Articles were included if they (1) were published in English; (2) had an observational study design with individual-level exposure and outcome data, examined the effect of statin therapy, and reported the incidence of breast cancer; and (3) reported estimates of either the relative risk, odds ratios, or hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Similar percentages were found for most cancer subtypes: brain (41%), breast (38%), cervical (66%), colorectal (38%), lung (48%), prostate (45%), bladder (56%), head and neck (56%) and lymphoma (33%). Our results show that most trials in radiation oncology did not report the results in the registry. Almost half of these trials have not been published in the biomedical literature.

28938477,"Previous studies have implicated growth hormone (GH) in the progression of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and pancreatic. A mechanism by which GH may play this role in cancer is through the induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During the EMT process, epithelial cells lose their defining phenotypes, causing loss of cellular adhesion and increased cell migration. This review aims to carefully summarize the previous two decades of research that points to GH as an initiator of EMT, in both cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Sources were collected using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines by using specific GH- and/or EMT-related terms. Identified manuscripts were selected for further analysis based on presentation of GH-induced molecular markers of the EMT process in vivo or in vitro. Cellular mechanisms involved in GH-induced EMT are the focus of this review, both in cancerous and noncancerous epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that a myriad of molecular mechanisms are induced by GH that cause EMT and may point to potential therapeutic use of GH antagonists or any downregulator of GH action in EMT-related disease.",breast_neoplasms

All clinical parameters, the site of the biopsy, the size of the needle, the radiological findings, the pathological diagnoses as well as all available follow-up data were reviewed. The concordance between the radiological and pathological results was studied and a statistical analysis conforms to the Pearson Chi-square test was applied. The majority of our patients were above 40 years of age. A strong and statistically significant association was noted between radiological findings and histopathological results (Pearson's Chi-square test = 186.28, P ?? 0.0001) with only four discordant cases (1.97%). This discrepancy was not statistically associated with age, site of biopsy, needle size, or number of cores obtained (P = 0.621, P = 0.584, P = 0.786, and P = 0.478, respectively).

This was an institutional review board--approved study with a waiver of informed consent. DBT findings of 288 invasive breast cancers were reviewed according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. Detectability of breast cancer was quantified by the number of readers (0-3) who correctly detected the cancer in an independent blinded review. DBT features and the cancer detectability score according to molecular subtype were compared using Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance. Of 288 invasive cancers, 194 were hormone receptor (HR)-positive, 48 were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and 46 were triple negative breast cancers. The most common DBT findings were irregular spiculated masses for HR-positive cancer, fine pleomorphic or linear branching calcifications for HER2 positive cancer and irregular masses with circumscribed margins for triple negative breast cancers (p < 0.001). Cancer detectability on DBT was not significantly different according to molecular subtype (p = 0.213) but rather affected by tumour size, breast density and presence of mass or calcifications. Breast cancers showed different imaging features according to molecular subtype; however, it did not affect the cancer detectability on DBT.

28934992,"Metastases to the thyroid are rare. The most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. Overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. There are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. Isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. Here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature. A 62-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman was diagnosed as having bilateral breast carcinoma in 2004, for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The pathology revealed multifocal disease on the right, T2N0(0/20)M0 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, and on the left side, T3N1(2/18)M0 grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy. The disease was under control on hormonal therapy until 2016, when she developed cervical lymphadenopathy. The fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid was reported as papillary thyroid cancer; and the fine-needle biopsy of the left lateral nodal disease was more suggestive of breast malignancy. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and a clearance of the central compartment lymph nodes and a biopsy of the lateral nodal disease. The histopathological analysis was consistent with metastatic breast cancer in the thyroid and lymph nodes with no evidence of a primary thyroid malignancy. A past history of a malignancy elsewhere should raise the index of suspicion of metastatic disease in patients presenting with thyroid lumps with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Detection of metastases to the thyroid generally indicates poor prognosis, obviating the need of surgery in an already compromised patient. An empirical thyroidectomy should be considered in select patients for local disease control.",breast_neoplasms
28934284,"One of the critical mechanisms of gastrointestinal cancer pathogenesis is the silencing of death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), which could be caused by aberrant methylation of the promoter. However, the relationship between DAPK1 methylation and the risk of gastrointestinal cancer is still controversial. Hence, we conducted this study to determine the potential correlation. Eligible publications were searched in the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through November 2016 according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Revman 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software were used to analyze the relevant data regarding the association between the frequency of DAPK1 methylation and gastrointestinal cancer. A total of 22 studies with 2406 patients were included in this meta analysis. Methylation of DAPK1 was positively related with the risk of gastrointestinal cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76-10.38, P<0.00001, random effects model). The source of heterogeneity was analyzed by sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis. After omitting one heterogeneous study, the I2 decreased and the OR increased in pooled analysis. Also, the heterogeneity decreased most significantly in the subgroup of studies that had a sample size of less than 60 cases. Then, the correlations between DAPK1 methylation and clinicopathological features of gastrointestinal cancer were assessed. DAPK1 methylation was positively correlated with the lymph node (N) stage (positive vs. negative, OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.01-2.06, P = 0.04, fixed effects model) and poor differentiation (OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.02-2.35, P = 0.04, fixed effects model) in gastric cancer, and the association was significant among Asian patients. However, among cases of gastrointestinal cancer, the association between DAPK1 methylation and tumor (T) stage, N stage, distant metastasis (M) stage, and cancer differentiation were not statistically significant. DAPK1 methylation is a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer. Further analysis of the clinicopathological features indicated that aberrant methylation of DAPK1 is positively associated with the tumorigenesis of gastrointestinal cancer, and metastasis of gastric cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Farmers and their wives provided information on insecticide use, demographics, and reproductive history at enrollment in 1993-1997 and in 5-y follow-up interviews. Cancer incidence was determined via cancer registries. Among 30,594 wives with no history of breast cancer before enrollment, we examined breast cancer risk in relation to the women's and their husbands' insecticide use using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During an average 14.7-y follow-up, 39% of the women reported ever using insecticides, and 1,081 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Although ever use of insecticides overall was not associated with breast cancer risk, risk was elevated among women who had ever used the organophosphates chlorpyrifos [HR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0)] or terbufos [HR=1.5 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.1)], with nonsignificantly increased risks for coumaphos [HR=1.5 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.5)] and heptachlor [HR=1.5 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.9)]. Risk in relation to the wives' use was associated primarily with premenopausal breast cancer. We found little evidence of differential risk by tumor estrogen receptor status. Among women who did not apply pesticides, the husband's use of fonofos was associated with elevated risk, although no exposure-response trend was observed. Use of several organophosphate insecticides was associated with elevated breast cancer risk. However, associations for the women's and husbands' use of these insecticides showed limited concordance. Ongoing cohort follow-up may help clarify the relationship, if any, between individual insecticide exposures and breast cancer risk. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1295.",breast_neoplasms
28931370,"There is evidence that some ovarian tumours evoke an immune response, which can be assessed by tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). To facilitate adoption of TILs as a clinical biomarker, a standardised method for their H&E visual evaluation has been validated in breast cancer. We sought to investigate the prognostic significance of TILs in a study of 953 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer tumour samples, both primary and metastatic, from 707 patients from the prospective population-based SEARCH study. TILs were analysed using a standardised method based on H&E staining producing a percentage score for stromal and intratumoral compartments. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios of the association between TILs and survival. The extent of stromal and intra-tumoral TILs were correlated in the primary tumours (n?=?679, Spearman's rank correlation?=?0.60, P?<?0.001) with a similar correlation in secondary tumours (n?=?224, Spearman's rank correlation?=?0.62, P?<?0.001). There was a weak correlation between stromal TIL levels in primary and secondary tumour samples (Spearman's rank correlation?=?0.29, P?<?0.001) and intra-tumoral TIL levels in primary and secondary tumour samples (Spearman's rank correlation?=?0.19, P?=?0.0094). The extent of stromal TILs differed between histotypes (Pearson chi2 (12d.f.) 54.1, P?<?0.0001) with higher levels of stromal infiltration in the high-grade serous and endometriod cases. A significant association was observed for higher intratumoral TIL levels and a favourable prognosis (HR 0.74 95% CI 0.55-1.00 p?=?0.047). This study is the largest collection of epithelial ovarian tumour samples evaluated for TILs. We have shown that stromal and intratumoral TIL levels are correlated and that their levels correlate with clinical variables such as tumour histological subtype. We have also shown that increased levels of both intratumoral and stromal TILs are associated with a better prognosis; however, this is only statistically significant for intratumoral TILs. This study suggests that a clinically useful immune prognostic indicator in epithelial ovarian cancer could be developed using this technique.",breast_neoplasms
28930807,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of patients at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome to select the extent of genetic testing personally preferred and the impact of demographic factors on the breadth of testing pursued. A single-institution cohort was enumerated consisting of patients referred for clinical genetic counseling secondary to risk of HBOC syndrome. This was a retrospective study of consecutive patients seen for genetic counseling; all patients completed an epidemiologic questionnaire and provided personal and family medical histories. Patients meeting guidelines for testing were offered testing at 3 levels: single gene/condition (Single), small panels with highly penetrant genes (Plus), and large panels with high and moderately penetrant genes (Next). Associations between personal or family-related factors and breadth of testing selected were investigated. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using Student t and ? tests, as appropriate. Joint classification tables were used to test for effect modification, and a log-binomial model was used to compute rate ratios (RR) with a threshold of P < 0.05 considered significant. We identified 253 patients who underwent genetic counseling for HBOC syndrome. Most patients were personally affected by cancer (63.6%), reported at least some college (79.2%), met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for BRCA testing (94.5%), and opted to undergo genetic testing (94.1%). Most (84.9%) patients opted for panel testing. An increased likelihood of choosing Next-level testing was found to be associated with patients having any college experience (RR, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.30), as well as being unaffected by cancer (RR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.64). Clinical genetic counseling is a highly specialized service, which should be provided to patients at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes. Although some epidemiologic factors can predict a patient's preference for testing breadth, patients were sufficiently able to self-identify the level of testing they were comfortable with after receiving genetic counseling. Most practitioners do not have the time or expertise to provide the degree of counseling needed to enable and empower patients to choose the level of testing they are comfortable with. When available, referral to genetic counselors remains an important component of comprehensive care for women with a personal or family history of cance",breast_neoplasms
28930692,"The addition of palbociclib to letrozole improves progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). This study assesses the cost-utility of palbociclib from the Canadian healthcare payer perspective. A probabilistic discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed and parameterised with data from the PALOMA 1 and 2 trials and other sources. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM) gained for palbociclib was calculated. A time horizon of 15 years was used in the base case with costs and effectiveness discounted at 5% annually. Time-to- progression and time-to-death were derived from a Weibull and exponential distribution. Expected costs were based on Ontario fees and other sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for parameter uncertainty. Compared to letrozole, the addition of palbociclib provided an additional 14.7 QALM at an incremental cost of $161,508. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $10,999/QALM gained. Assuming a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $4167/QALM, the probability of palbociclib to be cost-effective was 0%. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a WTP of $11,000/QALM gained, the probability of palbociclib to be cost-effective was 50%. The addition of palbociclib to letrozole is unlikely to be cost-effective for the treatment of ABC from a Canadian healthcare perspective with its current price. While ABC patients derive a meaningful clinical benefit from palbociclib, considerations should be given to increase the WTP threshold and reduce the drug pricing, to render this strategy more affordable.",breast_neoplasms
28929809,"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of decreasing breast compression during digital mammography and breast tomosynthesis (DBT) on perceived pain and image quality. In this two-part study, two groups of women with prior mammograms were recruited. In part 1, subjects were positioned for craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views, and four levels of compression force were applied to evaluate changes in breast thickness, perceived pain, and relative tissue coverage. No imaging was performed. In part 2, two MLO DBT images of one breast of each patient were acquired at standard and reduced compression. Blurring artifacts and tissue coverage were judged by three breast imaging radiologists, and compression force, breast thickness, relative tissue coverage, and perceived pain were recorded. Only the first reduction in force was feasible because further reduction resulted in inadequate breast immobilization. Mean force reductions of 48% and 47% for the CC and MLO views, respectively, resulted in a significantly reduced perceived pain level, whereas the thickness of the compressed breast increased by 0.02 cm (CC view) and 0.09 (MLO view, part 1 of the study) and 0.38 cm (MLO view, part 2 of the study), respectively, with no change in tissue coverage or increase in motion blurring.

Morphologic features (lesion size, margin, internal enhancement pattern) and time-signal intensity curve (TIC) type were also assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of malignancy, followed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance. ep, MaxSlope, size, margin and TIC type were independent predictors of malignancy. The diagnostic accuracy of logistic models based on qDCE parameters alone, morphological features plus TIC type, and all parameters combined was 94.9%, 89.0%, and 95.6% respectively. qDCE-MRI can be used to improve diagnostic differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions in relation to morphology and kinetic analysis. ep and MaxSlope were independent predictors of breast malignancy. ? qDCE-MRI has a better diagnostic ability than morphology and kinetic analysis. ? qDCE-MRI can be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast malignancy.",breast_neoplasms

RSL facilitates radiology-surgery scheduling and allows for improved oncoplasty compared with wire localization (WL). The purpose of this work was to compare the 2 techniques. We performed a retrospective study of all breast lesions operated with RSL between February 2013 and March 2015 at our university institution, and compared with an equivalent number of surgeries performed with a single WL. Imaging and pathology reports were reviewed for information on guidance mode, accuracy of targeting, nature of excised lesion, size and volume of surgical specimen, status of margins, and reinterventions. A total of 254 lesions (247 women) were excised with RSL and compared with 257 lesions (244 women) whose surgery was guided by WL. Both groups were comparable in lesion pathology, guidance mode for RSL or WL positioning, and accuracy of targeting (98% correct). Mean delay between biopsy and surgery was 84?days for RSL versus 103 after WL (P?=?.04). No differences were noted after RSL or WL for surgical specimen mean weight, largest diameter, and volume excised. For malignancies, the rate of positive margins was comparable (2.8%-3%), with 5 of 10 women in the RSL group who underwent a second surgery displaying residual malignancy compared with 3 of 9 women in the WL group. RSL is safe and accurate, and has comparable surgical endpoints to WL. Because RSL offers flexible scheduling and facilitated oncoplasty, RSL may replace WL for resection of nonpalpable single breast lesions.",breast_neoplasms

28926525,"Because of medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is now viewed as a chronic disease, rather than an imminent death sentence. Helping women live with this disease requires more than a medical approach to symptoms. Thus, a mentor-based and supportive-expressive program 'Be Resilient to Breast Cancer' (BRBC) was designed to help Chinese women with MBC enhance their resilience levels, biopsychosocial functions, and potentially extend their life span. A total of 226 women with MBC were randomly assigned, in a 1?:?1 ratio, to an intervention group (IG) that participated in BRBC or to a control group (CG) that received no intervention. Be Resilient to Breast Cancer was conducted for 120?min once a week. Primary outcomes were cancer-specific survival and secondary outcomes were resilience, Allostatic Load Index (ALI), anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). The Cox proportional-hazards model was used for survival analysis and growth mixture models were performed for secondary outcomes. Be Resilient to Breast Cancer did not significantly prolong 3- or 5-year survival (median survival, 36.7 months in IG and 31.5 months in CG). The hazard ratio for death was 0.736 (95% CI, 0.525-1.133, P=0.076; univariate Cox model) and 0.837 (95% CI, 0.578-1.211, P=0.345; multivariate Cox analysis).

Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), absolute risks, and the number needed to harm (NNH) were computed for prespecified safety and tolerability outcomes including cardiovascular events, bone fractures, second cancers (excluding new breast cancer), treatment discontinuation for adverse events, and death without recurrence. All statistical tests were two-sided. Seven trials comprising 16?349 patients met the inclusion criteria. Longer treatment with AIs was associated with increased odds of cardiovascular events (OR?=?1.18, 95% CI?=?1.00 to 1.40, P = .05, NNH = 122), bone fractures (OR?=?1.34, 95% CI?=?1.16 to 1.55, P < .001, NNH = 72), and treatment discontinuation for adverse events (OR?=?1.45, 95% CI?=?1.25 to 1.68, P < .001, NNH = 21).

To employ recombinant eukaryotic HER2-ECD subdomains to raise anti-HER2 antibodies and determine their anti-tumor activity in vitro. Two paired subdomains of HER2-ECD (DI+II and DIII+IV), representing Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab binding domains, respectively, along with the full extracellular domain of HER2 were generated in CHO-K1 cells. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against these subdomains and characterized using ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunoblot and their anti-tumor activity was assessed by XTT assay. The cross-reactivity of these antibodies was specified along with other members of the human HER family. Similar to Trastuzumab and anti-HER2-ECD antibody, anti-DI+II and DIII+IV polyclonal antibodies reacted with recombinant HER2-ECD and native HER2 expressed on tumor cells. These two polyclonal antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab to HER2, respectively, and did not cross-react with other members of HER family. These antibodies were able to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro, similar to Trastuzumab.

The authors queried a prospectively maintained database of all women who underwent partial mastectomy and oncoplastic reduction between 1994 and October of 2015. The autoaugmentation techniques were defined as (1) extended primary nipple autoaugmentation pedicle, and (2) primary nipple pedicle and secondary autoaugmentation pedicle. Comparisons were made to a control oncoplastic group. There were a total of 333 patients, 222 patients (67.7 percent) without autoaugmentation and 111 patients (33 percent) with autoaugmentation (51 patients with an extended autoaugmentation pedicle, and 60 patients with a secondary autoaugmentation pedicle). Biopsy weight was smallest in the extended pedicle group (136 g) and largest in the regular oncoplastic group (235 g; p = 0.017). Superomedial was the most common extended pedicle, and lateral was the most common location. Inferolateral was the most common secondary pedicle for lateral and upper outer defects. There were no significant differences in the overall complication rate: 15.5 percent in the regular oncoplastic group, 19.6 percent in the extended pedicle group, and 20 percent in the secondary pedicle group. Autoaugmentation techniques have evolved to manage complex defects not amenable to standard oncoplastic reduction methods. They are often required for lateral defects, especially in smaller breasts.

One of the major patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for measuring HRQoL in patients with breast cancer is provided by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Currently, paper-based surveys still predominate, as only a few reliable and validated electronic-based questionnaires are available. Facing the possibilities associated with evolving digitalization in medicine, validation of electronic versions of well-established PRO is essential in order to contribute to comprehensive and holistic oncological care and to ensure high quality in cancer research. The aim of this study was to analyze the reliability of a tablet-based measuring application for EORTC QLQ-C30 in German language in patients with adjuvant and (curative) metastatic breast cancer. Paper- and tablet-based questionnaires were completed by a total of 106 female patients with adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer recruited as part of the e-PROCOM study. All patients were required to complete the electronic- (e-PRO) and paper-based versions of the HRQoL EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. A frequency analysis was performed to determine descriptive sociodemographic characteristics. Both dimensions of reliability (parallel forms reliability [Wilcoxon test] and test of internal consistency [Spearman rho and agreement rates for single items, Pearson correlation and Kendall tau for each scale]) were analyzed. High correlations were shown for both dimensions of reliability (parallel forms reliability and internal consistency) in the patient's response behavior between paper- and electronic-based questionnaires. Regarding the test of parallel forms reliability, no significant differences were found in 27 of 30 single items and in 14 of 15 scales, whereas a statistically significant correlation in the test of consistency was found in all 30 single items and all 15 scales. The evaluated e-PRO version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 is reliable for patients with both adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer, showing a high correlation in almost all questions (and in many scales). Thus, we conclude that the validated paper-based PRO assessment and the e-PRO tool are equally valid. However, the reliability should also be analyzed in other prospective trials to ensure that usability is reliable in all patient groups.

28911335,"Phyllodes tumor is a rare breast mass. Most phyllodes tumors are benign, but occasionally some show malignancy. Even if the tumors are benign, they can easily show recurrence. We report a case of a 48-year-old Asian woman, who had previously undergone a tumorectomy of her left breast 12?years before, with a pathological diagnosis of fibroadenoma. Five years after the initial tumorectomy, the patient presented with an abnormally enlarged left breast. A biopsy determined the growth to be a phyllodes tumor; subsequently, a partial mastectomy was conducted. However, the patient's left breast showed rapid enlargement in the next 5?months. The treating physicians suspected a relapse and subsequently consulted with our hospital. The breast mass was resected at our institution. After this surgery, the patient had repeated episodes of relapse and underwent four additional operations. Since then, the patient has not had any additional relapse so far. We present a case of a phyllodes tumor with multiple episodes of relapse. Although phyllodes tumors commonly show relapse, this case was unique because of the number of episodes of relapse. This case highlights the need to carry out tumorectomy with adequate margins with subsequent careful observation to check for relapse.",breast_neoplasms

28911064,"From most recent available data, we predicted cancer mortality statistics in selected Latin American countries for the year 2017, with focus on lung cancer. We obtained death certification data from the World Health Organization and population data from the Pan American Health Organization database for all neoplasms and selected cancer sites. We derived figures for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. Using a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint model, we estimated number of deaths and age-standardized (world population) mortality rates in 2017. Total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline in all countries. The highest mortality rates for 2017 are in Cuba, i.e. 132.3/100?000 men and 93.3/100?000 women. Mexico had the lowest predicted rates, 64.7/100?000 men and 60.6/100?000 women. In contrast, the total number of cancer deaths is expected to rise due to population ageing and growth. Men showed declines in lung cancer trends in all countries and age groups considered, while only Colombian and Mexican women had downward trends. Stomach and (cervix) uteri rates are predicted to continue their declines, though mortality from these neoplasms remains comparatively high. Colorectal, breast and prostate cancer rates were predicted to decline moderately, as well as leukaemias. There was no clear pattern for pancreatic cancer. Between 1990 and 2017 about 420?000 cancer deaths were avoided in 5 of the 7 countries, no progress was observed in Brazil and Cuba. Cancer mortality rates for 2017 in seven selected Latin American countries are predicted to decline, though there was appreciable variability across countries. Mortality from major cancers-including lung and prostate-and all cancers remains comparatively high in Cuba, indicating the need for improved prevention and management.",breast_neoplasms

The cohort consisted of 1039 breast cancer patients who underwent sentinel node (SN) biopsy using the OSNA assay. Cutoff value of the SN tumour burden stratifying distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was determined, and predictive factors for DDFS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were investigated. pN(mol) classification of the SN status was defined as: pN0(mol)(sn), SN negative; pN1mi(mol)(sn), SN positive and tumour burden <cutoff-value; and pN1(mol)(sn), tumour burden ?cutoff-value. Median follow-up time; 68.3 months. Cutoff value of the SN tumour burden was 2810 copies per ??l. Of the 1039 patients, 798, 95, and 146 had pN0(mol)(sn), pN1mi(mol)(sn), and pN1(mol)(sn) status, respectively.

28903664,"There is renewed interest in identifying breast cancer patients' participation in decision-making about adjuvant chemotherapy. There is a gap in the literature regarding the impact of these decisions on quality of life (QOL) and quality of care (QOC). Our aims were to determine similarities and differences in how patients diagnosed with breast cancer preferred to make decisions with providers about cancer treatment, to examine the patient's recall of her role when the decision was made about chemotherapy and to determine how preferred and actual roles, as well as congruence between them, relate to QOL and perceived QOC. Greater Plains Collaborative clinical data research network of PCORnet conducted the 'Share Thoughts on Breast Cancer' survey among women 12-18 months post-diagnosis at eight sites in seven Midwestern United States. Patients recalled their preferred and actual treatment decision-making roles and three new shared decision-making (SDM) variables were created. Patients completed QOL and QOC measurements. Correlations and t-tests were used. Of 1235 returned surveys, 873 (full sample) and 329 (subsample who received chemotherapy) were used. About one-half of women in both the full (50.7%) and subsample (49.8%,) preferred SDM with providers about treatment decisions, but only 41.2% (full) and 42.6% (subsample) reported experiencing SDM. Significant differences were found between preferred versus actual roles in the full (p?<?.001) and subsample (p?<?.004). In the full sample, there were no relationships between five decision-making variables with QOL, but there was an association with QOC. The subsample's decision-making variables related to several QOL scales and QOC items, with a more patient-centered decision than originally preferred related to higher physical and social/family well-being, overall QOL and QOC.

28901323,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for the precise individualized treatment including trastuzumab of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are the routine analyses for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. However, IHC is variable and depends on the evaluator, and FISH is a labor intensive and expensive method. We evaluated the feasibility of droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) as a precise and quantitative method for HER2 amplification test. We used ddPCR to confirm HER2 amplification status in 24 breast cancer and 29 gastric cancer samples to validate the HER2 cutoff value in ddPCR. After setting cutoff value, all the above-mentioned samples were tested by IHC. Afterward, another 51 equivocal IHC 2+ gastric cancer samples were further determined by FISH and ddPCR, respectively, and the concordance between ddPCR and FISH was calculated. We set the HER2 cutoff value at 1.8. The concordance rate of HER2 status between ddPCR and IHC was 94.4% (17 out of 18) in 24 breast cancer samples. In 29 gastric cancer specimens, the concordance rate of HER2 amplification between ddPCR and IHC was 100% (22 out of 22). At last, compared with FISH determined HER2 status, ddPCR HER2 scores correctly classified 44 of 51 cases with 86.3% concordance in 51 equivocal IHC 2+ gastric cancer samples. ddPCR was able to identify HER2 amplification status in breast and gastric cancers with precise correlation with IHC and FISH results.

A literature search was performed for comparative studies reporting outcomes of both RFA and HR for HCC. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. A total of 4812 patients with HCC were included, with 2419 in the RFA group and 2393 in the HR group. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates in the HR group were significantly higher than those in the RFA group (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58-0.79, P < 0.00001; OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.50-0.65, P < 0.00001, respectively). 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-free survival and correspond recurrence-free survival rates were all better in HR group.

It seems ethically necessary to inform women so that they can actively participate in decision-making and make an informed choice based on their values and preferences. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of receiving information about the benefits and harms of screening on decision-making, in women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening. A two-stage, randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the first stage, 40 Basic Health Areas (BHAs) will be selected and randomized to intervention or control. In the second stage, women within each BHA will be randomly selected (n?=?400). Four breast cancer screening programs (BCSPs) of the Spanish public health system, three in Catalonia and one in the Canary Islands will participate in the study. Women in the intervention arm will receive a leaflet with detailed information on the benefits and harms of screening using mammography. Women in the control arm will receive a standard leaflet that does not mention harms and recommends accepting the invitation to participate in the biennial examinations of the BCSP. The primary outcome is informed choice, a dichotomous variable that combines knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Secondary outcomes include decisional conflict; confidence in the decision made; anxiety about screening participation; worry about breast cancer; anticipated regret; time perspective; perceived importance of benefits/harms of screening; perceived risk of breast cancer; and leaflet acceptability. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed 2-3 weeks after the intervention. This is the first RCT that assesses the effect of informing about the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening in Spain in women facing the decision to be screened using mammography. It aims to assess the impact of information on several decisional outcomes and to contribute to paving the road towards shared decision-making in breast cancer screening in our country.

A phase I study of anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody LJM716 was conducted with the primary objective to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE), and dosing schedule. Secondary objectives were to characterize safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity. This open-label, dose-finding study comprised dose escalation, followed by expansion in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or esophagus, and HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer or gastric cancer. During dose escalation, patients received LJM716 intravenous once weekly (QW) or every two weeks (Q2W), in 28-day cycles. An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model was used to guide dose escalation and establish the RDE. Exploratory pharmacodynamic tumor studies evaluated modulation of HER3 signaling. Patients received LJM716 3-40?mg/kg QW and 20?mg/kg Q2W (54 patients; 36 patients at 40?mg/kg QW). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported during dose-escalation. One patient experienced two DLTs (diarrhea, hypokalemia [both grade 3]) in the expansion phase. The RDE was 40?mg/kg QW, providing drug levels above the preclinical minimum effective concentration. One patient with gastric cancer had an unconfirmed partial response; 17/54 patients had stable disease, two lasting >30?weeks. Down-modulation of phospho-HER3 was observed in paired tumor samples. LJM716 was well tolerated; the MTD was not reached, and the RDE was 40?mg/kg QW. Further development of LJM716 is ongoing.

Full-section and TMA (three 0.6-mm cores and two 1.0-mm cores) slides of 109 cases were stained with Ki-67 antibody. We assessed two ways of collapsing TMA cores: a weighted approach and mitotically active approach. For cases with at least a single 0.6-mm TMA core (n = 107), 16% were misclassified using a mitotically active approach and 11% using a weighted approach. For cases with at least a single 1.0-mm TMA core (n = 101), 5% were misclassified using either approach. For the 0.6-mm core group, there were 33.3% discordant cases. The number of discordant cases increased from 18% in the group of two cores to 40% in the group of three cores (P = .039). Ki-67 tumor heterogeneity was common in luminal/HER2- BC.

Peripheral neuropathy, a well-known toxicity with paclitaxel, may be of interest in predicting the efficacy of paclitaxel therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. We performed a retrospective analysis assessing whether the early occurrence of peripheral neuropathy (EPN) was a predictive marker for better efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy containing paclitaxel. Between January 2000 and August 2008, we examined the records of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel in our hospital. EPN was defined as a symptom of Grade 2 or more during first three months of treatment. The overall response rate (ORR) and time to treatment failure (TTF) in each group were analyzed retrospectively. Of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with paclitaxel, EPN was documented in 101 patients (60.1%). The clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, and SD ?? 6 months) was 72.3% in the EPN group and 49.3% in the non-EPN group (p = 0.002).

The role of surgical ovarian ablation has been revitalized based on the advances of minimally invasive surgery, and a better understanding of clinical and molecular basis of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndromes. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic BSO and GnRH analogue administration in patients aged 40-49?years with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. A probabilistic decision tree model was developed to evaluate costs and outcomes of ovarian ablation through laparoscopic BSO, or ovarian suppression through monthly injections of GnRH analogue. Results were expressed as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Laparoscopic BSO strategy was associated with a lower mean total cost per patient than GnRH treatment, and considering the difference in terms of QALYs, the incremental effectiveness did not demonstrate a notable difference between the two approaches. From the National Health Service perspective, and for a time horizon of 5?years, laparoscopic BSO was the dominant option compared to GnRH treatment; laparoscopic BSO was less expensive than GnRH, ??2385 [95% confidence interval (CI)?=?2044, 2753] vs ??7093 (95% CI?=?3409, 12,105), respectively, and more effective.

Despite improvement in diagnosis, the survival rate of this disease has still not improved. X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) has been shown to be over-expressed in various cancers leading to poor overall survival. However, the role of XIAP in breast cancer from Middle Eastern region has not been fully explored. We examined the expression of XIAP in more than 1000 Middle Eastern breast cancer cases by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by western blotting. Finally, in vivo studies were performed on nude mice following xenografting and treatment with inhibitors. XIAP was found to be over-expressed in 29.5% of cases and directly associated with clinical parameters such as tumor size, extra nodal extension, triple negative breast cancer and poorly differentiated breast cancer subtype. In addition, XIAP over-expression was also significantly associated with PI3-kinase pathway protein; p-AKT, proliferative marker; Ki-67 and anti-apoptotic marker; PARP. XIAP over-expression in our cohort of breast cancer was an independent poor prognostic marker in multivariate analysis. Next, we investigated inhibition of XIAP using a specific inhibitor; embelin and found that embelin treatment led to inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Finally, breast cancer cells treated with combination of embelin and PI3-kinase inhibitor; LY294002 synergistically induced apoptosis and caused tumor growth regression in vivo. These data suggest that XIAP may be playing an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and can be therapeutically targeted either alone or in combination with PI3-kinase inhibition to induce efficient apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",breast_neoplasms

The aim of this study was to investigate methylation of a panel of commonly methylated breast cancer genes in familial MBCs. 60 tumours from 3 BRCA1 and 25 BRCA2 male mutation carriers and 32 males from BRCAX families were assessed for promoter methylation by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting in a panel of 10 genes (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MAL, RAR?, CDH1, RUNX3, FOXC1 and GSTP1). An average methylation index (AMI) was calculated for each case comprising the average of the methylation of the 10 genes tested as an indicator of overall tumour promoter region methylation. Promoter hypermethylation and AMI were correlated with BRCA carrier mutation status and clinicopathological parameters including tumour stage, grade, histological subtype and disease specific survival. Tumours arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers showed significantly higher methylation of candidate genes, than those arising in non-BRCA2 familial MBCs (average AMI 23.6 vs 16.6, p?=?0.01, 45% of genes hypermethylated vs 34%, p?<?0.01).

28886093,"To compare the concordance in risk classification between the EndoPredict and the MammaPrint scores obtained for the same cancer samples on 40 estrogen-receptor positive/HER2-negative breast carcinomas. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinoma tissues that were previously analyzed with MammaPrint as part of routine care of the patients, and were classified as high-risk (20 patients) and low-risk (20 patients), were selected to be analyzed by the EndoPredict assay, a second generation gene expression test that combines expression of 8 genes (EP score) with two clinicopathological variables (tumor size and nodal status, EPclin score). The EP score classified 15 patients as low-risk and 25 patients as high-risk. EPclin re-classified 5 of the 25 EP high-risk patients into low-risk, resulting in a total of 20 high-risk and 20 low-risk tumors. EP score and MammaPrint score were significantly correlated (p = 0.008). Twelve of 20 samples classified as low-risk by MammaPrint were also low-risk by EP score (60%). 17 of 20 MammaPrint high-risk tumors were also high-risk by EP score. The overall concordance between EP score and MammaPrint was 72.5% (?? = 0.45, (95% CI, 0.182 to 0.718)). EPclin score also correlated with MammaPrint results (p = 0.004). Discrepancies between both tests occurred in 10 cases: 5 MammaPrint low-risk patients were classified as EPclin high-risk and 5 high-risk MammaPrint were classified as low-risk by EPclin and overall concordance of 75% (?? = 0.5, (95% CI, 0.232 to 0.768)). This pilot study demonstrates a limited concordance between MammaPrint and EndoPredict. Differences in results could be explained by the inclusion of different gene sets in each platform, the use of different methodology, and the inclusion of clinicopathological parameters, such as tumor size and nodal status, in the EndoPredict test.",breast_neoplasms
28885360,"The prognostic significance of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in patients with breast cancer (BC) remains controversial. The aims of our meta-analysis are to evaluate its association with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value in patients with breast cancer. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were systematically searched up to December 2016. The meta-analysis was performed using hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect measures. A fixed or random effect model was used depending on the heterogeneity analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Review manager software version 5.3. Seventeen studies including 4343 patients with breast cancer were analyzed. The meta-analysis indicated that breast cancers with PTEN loss were significantly associated with the tumor size ??2?cm group (ORFEM?=?1.68, 95%CIFEM [1.34, 2.10]), negative expression of estrogen receptor (ORREM?=?1.95, 95%CIREM [1.09, 3.49]), negative expression of progesterone receptor (ORFEM?=?1.72, 95%CIFEM [1.43, 2.08]), the advanced stage (ORREM?=?1.94, 95%CIREM [1.35, 2.80]), positive axillary lymph node metastasis (ORREM?=?1.80, 95%CIREM [1.30, 2.50]), and the local recurrence (ORFEM?=?1.70, 95%CIFEM [1.26, 2.28]). None of other clinicopathological parameters such as the HER2 status and distant metastasis were associated with PTEN loss. The decreased PTEN expression was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of patients (HRREM?=?1.83, 95%CIREM [1.32, 2.53]) and the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients (HRREM?=?2.43, 95%CIREM [1.31, 4.53]).

A 32?cm lateral diameter (CIRS model 062M, Norfolk, Virginia) electron density phantom containing inserts which simulated the chemical composition of eight tissues in a solid-water background was scanned using SECT and DECT. A liquid water insert was included to confirm CT number accuracy. All materials were also placed in four water tanks, ranging from 15 to 45?cm in lateral width and scanned using DECT and SECT. A silicone breast implant was scanned in the same water phantoms. SPR values were calculated based on commercial software (syngo CT Dual Energy, Siemens Healthcare GmbH) and compared to reference values derived from proton beam measurements. Accuracy and precision were quantified across phantom size using percent error and standard deviation. Graphical and regression analysis were used to determine whether SECT or DECT was superior in estimating SPR across phantom size. Both DECT and SECT SPR data resulted in good agreement with the reference values. Percent error was ??3% for both DECT and SECT in all materials except lung and dense bone. The coefficient of variation (CV) across materials and phantom sizes was 1.12% for SECT and 0.96% for DECT. Material-specific regression and graphical analysis did not reveal size dependence for either technique but did show reduced systematic bias with DECT for dense bone and liver. Mean percent error in SPR for the implant was reduced from 11.46% for SECT to 0.49% for DECT.

Retrospectively, breast cancer patients with bone metastasis were included. BM metastasis was considered if the lesion was PET positive/CT occult while bone metastasis was considered if the lesion was PET positive/ CT positive. BM metastases were observed sequentially on F18-FDG PET/CT. We included 35 patients. Eighteen patients (51%) had BM metastases in addition to other bone metastases. BM metastases comprised 24% of all lesions. Posttreatment scan was performed on 26/35 patients. Twenty-three percent of BM metastases had resolved completely without causing bone destruction after treatment. Sixty-five percent of BM metastases had converted into bone metastases after treatment. Twelve percent of BM metastases had persisted after treatment. This retrospective study showed clinically by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging that BM metastasis is an early stage of bone metastasis in breast cancer. Interestingly, 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed that early eradication of individual BM metastasis by systemic treatment precluded development of bone metastasis.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine, D-mannose and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract (NDM), when associated to antibiotic therapy, in reducing the persistence of recurrent cystitis in this risk population. Sixty breast cancer survived women with recurrent cystitis were retrospectively examined. Group 1, comprised of 40 patients treated with antibiotic therapy associated with NDM lasting for six months, Group 2 comprised of 20 patients treated with antibiotics alone. The use of NDM in combination with antibiotic therapy showed a significant reduction in positive urine cultures, compared to antibiotics alone. Subjects of Group 1 rather than those of Group 2, showed improvement in symptoms score of urgency, frequency, urge incontinence, recurrent cystitis, bladder and urethral pain.

28881357,"Discovery and validation of new antibody tractable targets is critical for the development of new antibody therapeutics to address unmet needs in oncology. A highly invasive clonal variant of the MDA-MB-435S cell line was used to generate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which were screened for anti-invasive activity against aggressive cancer cells in vitro. The molecular target of selected inhibitory MAb 9E1 was identified using immunoprecipitation/liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The potential anti-tumour effects of MAb 9E1 were investigated in vitro together with immunohistochemical analysis of the 9E1 target antigen in normal and cancer tissues. MAb 9E1 significantly decreases invasion in pancreatic, lung squamous and breast cancer cells and silencing of its target antigen, which was revealed as AnxA6, leads to markedly reduced invasive capacity of pancreatic and lung squamous cancer in vitro. IHC using MAb 9E1 revealed that AnxA6 exhibits a high prevalence of membrane immunoreactivity across aggressive tumour types with restricted expression observed in the majority of normal tissues. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, high AnxA6 IHC score correlated with the presence of tumour budding at the invasive front of tumours (P=0.082), the presence of perineural invasion (P= <0.0001) and showed a weak correlation with reduced survival (P=0.2242). This study highlights the use of phenotypic hybridoma screening as an effective strategy to select a novel function-blocking MAb, 9E1 with anti-cancer activity in vitro. Moreover, through characterisation of the 9E1 target antigen, AnxA6, our findings support further investigation of AnxA6 as a potential candidate target for antibody-mediated inhibition of pancreatic cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Prospectively collected anonymous information on primary breast cancer cases diagnosed and treated in the units is transferred annually to a central EUSOMA data warehouse for continuous monitoring of quality indicators (QIs) to improve quality of care. Units have to comply with the EUSOMA Breast Centre guidelines and are audited by peers. The database was started in 2006 and includes over 110,000 cancers from breast centres located in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Italy. The aim of the present study is assessing time trends of QIs in EUSOMA-certified breast centres over the decade 2006-2015. Previously defined QIs were calculated for 22 EUSOMA-certified breast centres (46122 patients) during 2006-2015. On the average of all units, the minimum standard of care was achieved in 8 of 13 main EUSOMA QIs in 2006 and in all in 2015. All QIs, except removal of at least 10 lymph nodes at axillary clearance and oestrogen receptor-negative tumours (T?>?1?cm or N+) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, improved significantly in this period. The desirable target was reached for two QIs in 2006 and for 7 of 13 QIs in 2015. The EUSOMA model of audit and monitoring QIs functions well in different European health systems and results in better performance of QIs over the last decade.

These testing results can be used to select preventive interventions and guide treatment. Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after testing have not previously been examined. 2009-2014. Medical claims data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases were used to estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing among women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States, both nationally and regionally. From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times (102.7 to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in nonmetropolitan areas. The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009 (102.7 versus 64.8) to 20% in 2014 (237.8 versus 191.3). The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased more over time in younger women than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West. Receipt of preventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service: the percentage of women who received a mastectomy was similar, the percentage of women who received magnetic resonance imaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas (as low as 5.8% in 2014 to as high as 8.2% in 2011) than metropolitan areas (as low as 7.3% in 2014 to as high as 10.3% in 2011), and the percentage of women who received mammography was lower in nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was similar in later years. Possible explanations for the 47% decrease in the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the study period include increased access to genetic services in nonmetropolitan areas and increased demand nationally as a result of publicity. The relative differences in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among women at younger ages compared with older ages. Improved data sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA testing in the United States, monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for BRCA testing, and assess receipt of preventive interventions for women with BRCA mutations. Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in receipt of BRCA testing while simultaneously educating the public and health care providers about U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and other clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling.",breast_neoplasms

Split ends (SPEN) is an ER? corepressor that we have identified as a tumor suppressor protein in ER?-positive breast cancer cells whose hormone-independent roles in breast cancer have never been explored. We determined the hormone-independent transcriptional program regulated by the ER? cofactor SPEN in breast cancer using DNA microarrays. The biological functions regulated by SPEN independently of hormones were studied in vitro in ER?-positive and ER?-negative breast cancer cells. Finally, we examined the clinical relevance of SPEN expression in cohorts of breast cancer samples with outcome data. We found that SPEN is coexpressed with a number of genes involved in ciliary biology, including the ciliogenic transcription factor RFX3, in a hormone-independent manner. SPEN reexpression in T47D cells containing a nonsense mutation in SPEN restored the primary cilium, whereas its knockdown in MCF10A and Hs578T cells considerably decreased primary cilia levels.

In this paper, we investigate the role of the spatial organisation of (dense vs. fatty) regions of the breast defined from mammographic images in terms of breast cancer risk. We present a novel approach that provides a thorough description of the spatial organisation of different types of tissue in the breast. Each mammogram is first segmented into four regions (fatty, semi-fatty, semi-dense and dense tissue). The spatial relations between each pair of regions is described using so-called forces histograms (FHs) and summarised using functional principal component analysis.

We also carried out a small validation study based on digital images. -4). Using digital images, we were able to verify that the same characteristics of tissue organisation can be identified and we validated the association for the spatial relations between the fatty and semi-fatty tissue. Our findings are consistent with the notion that fibroglandular and adipose tissue plays a role in breast cancer risk and, more specifically, they suggest that fatty tissue in the lower quadrants and the absence of density in the retromammary space, as shown in mediolateral oblique images, are protective against breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
28877230,"Adjuvant therapy decisions in early breast cancer are based on accurate risk assessment. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plaminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) have been the first biomarkers in hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer to reach highest level of evidence. The EndoPredict test (EPclin) combines gene expression information with nodal status and tumor size. The aim of this prospective study was to compare uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin as prognostic biomarkers with regard to feasibility, risk stratification and impact on adjuvant therapy recommendation. 395 patients with HR positive, HER2 negative, intermediate risk breast cancer were enrolled. Relations and concordance of histologic grading as well as EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 values were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Cohen's Kappa. To compare decision impact of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 three independent case discussions were held: One with known uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin results, one blinded to EPclin alone and another one blinded to both EPclin and uPA/PAI-1. EPclin could be determined in all 395 (100%), uPA/PAI-1 in 190 (48%) of the tumor samples. EPclin allocated 250 patients (63%) to the low-risk group and 145 patients (37%) to the high-risk group, whereas uPA/PAI-1 allocated 88 patients (46%) to the low-risk group and 102 patients (54%) to the high-risk group. In 59% of cases, both tests showed concordant results. EPclin resulted more frequently in a change of therapy recommendation than the uPA/PAI-1 test (46% vs 24%). Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) was abandoned twice as often by EPclin (45%) compared to uPA/PAI-1 (22%). In this first prospective comparison of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 we found, that EPclin is superior to uPA/PAI-1 with respect to feasibility and decision impact.

Clinical and histological parameters were analysed. A total of 185 patients were identified. The median age of the patients was 42 years. There were 89 (48.1%) patients with a benign tumour, 34 (18.4%) with a borderline tumour and 62 (33.5%) with a malignant tumour. The size of the tumours ranged from 11 to 460 mm, with a mean of 106.1mm and SD of 79.6. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) was performed on 64.3% of patients and 35.7% of patients had a mastectomy. There was an overall local recurrence rate of 3.78% (2.2% for the benign tumours and 8.1% for the malignant tumours). No clinical or histological factors were found to significantly predict local recurrence. Since our study did not find any predictors of local recurrence, we suggest that a wide local excision with 1 cm margins might be unnecessary, and perhaps a negative margin combined with a close follow up for two years after excision is necessary.",breast_neoplasms

Almost one-quarter (23.1%; 15.6% of adults aged 65-74, 42.7% of adults aged 75-79) of the study population had an estimated LE of less than 10?years. Annual fecal occult blood test and biannual mammography rates among adults aged 65 to 74 with a LE of 10?years or longer were 37.1% and 70.0%, respectively.

Identifying novel molecular signaling pathways participating in gastric tumorigenesis and progression is pivotal for rational design of targeted therapies to improve advanced GC outcome. Recently, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein 29 (ERp29) has been shown to inversely associate with primary tumor development and function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, the role of ERp29 in GC patients' prognosis and its function in GC progression is unknown. Clinical importance of ERp29 in the prognosis of GC patients was assessed by examining its expression in 148 GC tumor samples and correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and survival of the patients. The function and underlying mechanisms of ERp29 in GC growth, invasion and metastasis were explored both in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of ERp29 was commonly found in GC tissues and highly correlated with more aggressive phenotypes and poorer prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of ERp29 increased GC cell migration and invasion and promoted metastasis. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of ERp29 produced opposite effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that loss of ERp29 induced an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the GC cells through activation of PI3K/Akt pathway signaling. These findings suggest that downregulation of ERp29 is probably one of the key molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of GC.",breast_neoplasms

From January 2014 until May 2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 10?336 patients consented to tumor DNA sequencing. Since May 2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 2017. Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines. Proportion of clinically actionable germline mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by guideline-directed testing. Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5-66 years), 65.3% were male, and 81.3% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 182 (17.5%; 95% CI, 15.3%-19.9%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested (9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1%-11.7%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations. Frequency of inherited mutations was related to case mix, stage, and founder mutations. Germline findings led to discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 patients tested (3.7%) and predictive testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3%), including 6 for whom genetic evaluation would not have been initiated by guideline-based testing. In this referral population with selected advanced cancers, universal sequencing of a broad panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and tumor DNA samples was associated with increased detection of individuals with potentially clinically significant heritable mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based on current clinical guidelines.

As part of an institutional review board-approved, prospective clinical trial of Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02286843), a second group of 11 patients with HER2-negative primary breast cancer and known metastatic disease were recruited. Patients with confirmed HER2-negative primary breast cancer underwent Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT to screen for Zr-trastuzumab-avid lesions suggestive of unsuspected HER2-positive metastases. Zr-trastuzumab-avid lesions on PET/CT were biopsied and pathologically examined to determine HER2 status. All 11 patients had confirmed HER2-negative primary breast cancer. Four patients demonstrated suspicious foci on Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT. Of these 4 patients, 1 patient had biopsy-proven HER2-positive metastases. The other 3 patients with suspicious Zr-trastuzumab-avid foci had biopsy demonstrating a metastasis that was HER2-negative and were considered false-positive Zr-trastuzumab PET foci. Combined with a published report of the first 9 patients, there have been a total of 20 HER2-negative primary breast cancer patients, with 3 patients (15%) having pathologically confirmed HER2-positive distant metastases and 6 (30%) with suspicious Zr-trastuzumab-avid foci that were HER2-negative on pathology, which were thus considered false-positive Zr-trastuzumab findings. This second group of patients confirms the proof of concept that Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT detects unsuspected HER2-positive metastases in a subset of patients with HER2-negtive primary breast cancer. False-positive Zr-trastuzumab-avid foci present a challenge to using this tracer.",breast_neoplasms

The local recurrence (LR) rate was significantly lower with surgery and SRS (1-year LR rate, 36.7% vs 20.5%; P=.007). There was no difference in radiation necrosis (RN) by resection status, but there was a significantly increased RN rate with postoperative SRS versus with preoperative SRS and with SRS alone (1-year RN rate, 22.6% vs 5% and 12.3%, respectively; P<.001). OS was significantly higher with surgery and SRS (2-year OS rate, 38.9% vs 19.8%; P=.01). Both multivariate adjusted analyses and propensity score-matched analyses demonstrated similar results. In this retrospective study, gross total resection with SRS was associated with significantly reduced LR compared with SRS alone for patients with large BMs. Postoperative SRS was associated with the highest rate of RN. Surgical resection with SRS may improve outcomes in patients with a limited number of large BMs compared with SRS alone. Further studies are warranted.",breast_neoplasms

A retrospective study was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent screening FFDM in 2010-2012 and DBT in 2012-2013 at an academic institution. Examinations were performed by five experienced technologists who underwent updated standardized positioning training. Positioning criteria were assessed by consensus reads among three breast radiologists and compared with FS mammography data from a 1993 study by Bassett and colleagues. One hundred seventy patients (n = 340 examinations) were analyzed, showing significant differences between FFDM and DBT examinations (p < 0.05) for medial or inferior skin folds (FFDM vs DBT: craniocaudal [CC] view, 16% [n = 56] vs 23% [n = 77]; mediolateral oblique [MLO] view, 35% [n = 118] vs 45% [n = 154]), inclusion of lateral glandular tissue on CC view (FFDM vs DBT, 73% [n = 247] vs 81% [n = 274]), and concave pectoralis muscle shape (FFDM vs DBT, 36% [n = 121] vs 28% [n = 95]). In comparison with Bassett et al. data, all positioning criteria for both FFDM and DBT examinations were significantly different (p < 0.05). The largest differences were found in visualization of the pectoralis muscle on CC views and the inframammary fold on MLO views, inclusion of posterior or lateral glandular tissue, and inclusion of skin folds, with DBT and FFDM more frequently exhibiting all criteria than originally reported Bassett et al.  DBT and FFDM mammograms more frequently include posterior or lateral tissue, the inframammary fold on MLO views, the pectoralis muscle on CC views, and skin folds than FS mammograms. Inclusion of more breast tissue with newer technologies suggests traditional positioning standards, in conjunction with updated standardized positioning training, are still applicable at the expense of including more skin folds.",breast_neoplasms
28871004,"Thyroid cancer is one of the most frequent types of endocrine cancers. In most cases, thyroid cancers are caused by deregulated miRNA expression, especially involving the miR17-92 cluster. miR17-92 transcription is altered in several different tumor types including lymphoma, leukemia, and of the breast and thyroid. As an intronic cluster, miR17-92 must be processed during splicing and therefore interaction between microprocessor and spliceosome machineries is of major importance in understanding its expression. We investigated the protein composition of spliceosomes assembled on pre-RNAs containing intronic miR18a and miR19a, components of the miR17-92 cluster, using mass spectrometry. Interestingly, we observed that proteins associated with intronic miR18a and miR19a are cell-specific, and are similar for both miRNAs analyzed. The only exception is the group of heterogeneous nuclear proteins that are commonly recruited by different cells. miRNA processing depends on cell-specific proteins and heterogeneous nuclear proteins have a general role in miRNA processing from introns.",breast_neoplasms

All patients underwent digital mammography and additional DBT. A total of 40/69 (58%) cancers were detected on both mammography and DBT, 23 (33.3%) were only seen on DBT (p=0.0001); 6/69 (8.7%) carcinomas were not detected by either method, of which three were invasive lobular carcinomas. Sensitivity for multifocal/multicentric disease was significantly higher on DBT (12/19, 63.2%) compared to mammography (4/19, 21.1%) (p=0.02), specificity was comparable (96.0% vs. 90.0%). Multifocal/multicentric disease was not detected on mammography nor DBT in 7/19 (36.8%) patients, including three invasive lobular carcinomas.

A series of RRSO specimens (including endometrial biopsy) from women carrying a BRCA mutation, BRCA-unknown and BRCA-negative were collected between January 1998 and April 2016 at the Division of Gynecology at the European Institute of Oncology. Inclusion criteria were: asymptomatic women who had a negative gynecologic screening within 3 months prior to RRSO. Exclusion criteria were: women with ovarian/tubal cancer prior to RRSO. A total of 411 women underwent RRSO. Median age at RRSO was 47.0 years (range=32-70 years); 75.2% had a history of breast cancer. Fifteen women were diagnosed with an occult cancer (7 STIC, 4 invasive cancers, 2 breast cancers metastatic to the adnexa, 2 endometrial cancer) (3.6%). Sixteen showed a STIL (3.9%). When excluding cases with preoperative positive markers, the occult invasive cancer rate drops to 1.5%. Our study, covering an 18-year period, shows a substantial low risk of occult cancer among a high-risk population of women undergoing RRSO. Our data still support the indication for RRSO in higher-risk patients. An endometrial biopsy should also be routinely obtained as it raises the chances of detecting occult endometrial cancers that may be otherwise missed.",breast_neoplasms

No large number subpopulation of pure DCIS has been reported. It is however known that mammography and ultrasound underestimate tumor dimension with increasing tumor size. We aimed to quantify this discrepancy. This retrospective analysis reviewed the ultrasound and mammography data from 173 patients with DCIS at the University of Cologne - Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics between the years 2007 and 2010. Of these 173 patients, 34 fulfilled the DCIS analysis requirements and were evaluated in this study. Overall, ultrasound underestimated tumor size 79.4% of the time, while overestimating only 20.6% of the time. Mammography underestimated tumor size in 50%, overestimated in 38.2%, correctly estimating in 11.8%. Over and underestimation distributions differed drastically above and a cut-off point of ??2 cm actual tumor size, with a significant shift toward severe underestimation by both methods above a tumor size of 2 cm. DCIS misestimation was defined as the absolute value of the difference between actual tumor size and pre-surgical measurement by an imaging method. Mean DCIS size misestimation (actual tumor size ??2 cm) was 3 mm for ultrasound and 6.2 mm for mammography. We support previous findings that ultrasound and mammography lose accuracy with increasing tumor size.

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathological features of DCIS by using FDG-PET findings, and we evaluated the possibility of using FDG-PET in DCIS cases as a biomarker of which lesions will go on to become invasive. We investigated the cases of 185 consecutive patients with primary breast cancer who were diagnosed as having DCIS or IDC and underwent FDG-PET preoperatively. max and the number of cases not detected by FDG-PET were significantly different between the DICS and IDC groups. The extent of the primary tumor was not significantly different between the two groups. In six cases (42.9%) of the 14 DCIS cases, no FDG uptake was detected by FDG-PET. The extent of tumor did not significantly differ between the two groups. In addition, all six cases without FDG uptake were of the diffuse-spread type, without mass formation. All eight cases with mass formation had FDG uptake. Our present findings suggest that the FDG-PET uptake reflects tumor burden or tumor density, which should be considered to be associated with the presence of invasion.",breast_neoplasms

For breast cancer, targeted therapies are frequently based on the molecular status of the tissue gained from the primary tumor operation. However, it is unclear whether metastases in different organs maintain the same status. We compared the estrogen- (ER), progesterone- (PgR) and HER2/neu receptor status of the primary tumor with brain metastases in a series of 24 consecutive breast cancer patients. 62.5-75% of patients exhibited a constant receptor status between the primary tumor and the brain metastasis, whereas discordance rates of 25-37.5% were found, depending on the receptor. The rate of ER and PgR expression was each 41.6% in the primary tumors and decreased to 12.5% and 16.6% in the brain metastases. In contrast, the rate for Her2+ tumors increased from 41.6% in primary breast cancer to 65.2% in the respective brain metastases. The Ki-67 proliferation index increased significantly from a mean of 21% at the primary tumor site to 60% in brain metastases (p<0.001). All anti-estrogen treated breast tumors lost the estrogen receptor expression in the brain metastases, whereas no Her2/neu conversions occurred after treatment with trastuzumab. In summary, receptor conversion is frequent during disease progression. Therefore, the receptor status of the primary tumor is invalid for planning a therapy targeted against brain metastases, especially after hormone-therapy. In these cases, new tissue collection by biopsy or resection is mandatory for the selection of adequate therapeutic targets and accurate decision-making for systemic therapies.",breast_neoplasms

RHO GTPase activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), a RAC-specific GTPase activating protein, binds to activated ARF6 and is recruited to the plasma membrane. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate if ARHGAP24 is involved in the ARF6-mediated formation of pseudopods in breast carcinoma cells. The formation of pseudopods induced by activated ARF6 was monitored using MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. The effect of knockdown of endogenous ARHGAP24 by siRNA was examined. Knockdown of ARHGAP24 in MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells increased the lifespan of pseudopods to retract, which resulted in increased length of pseudopods induced by activated ARF6. ARHGAP24 required a binding site of ARF6 to achieve ARF6-dependent actin remodeling.

We investigated the impact of ATA and DFO on the viability and proliferation of MCF-7 cancer cells. Moreover we performed enzymatic activity assays and computational analysis of the ATA and DFO effects on pro-oncogenic phosphatases PTP1B and SHP2. ATA and DFO decrease the viability and proliferation of breast cancer cells, but only ATA considerably reduces the activity of PTP1B and SHP2 phosphatases. Our studies indicated that ATA strongly inactivates and binds in the PTP1B and SHP2 active site, interacting with arginine residue essential for enzyme activity.

In previous study, we determined that 3,6-dihydroxyflavone (3,6-DHF) increases miR-34a significantly in breast carcinogenesis, but the mechanism remains unclear. We used qRT-PCR to analyze miR-34a and ten-eleven translocation (TET)1, TET2, TET3 levels in breast cancer cells. With a cellular breast carcinogenesis model and an experimental model of carcinogenesis in rats, TET1 levels were evaluated by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. TET1 and 5hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) levels were evaluated by immunofluorescence in nude mouse xenografts of MDA-MB-231 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) assayed for TET1 on the TET1 promoter, and dot blot analysis of DNA 5hmC was performed in MDA-MB-231 cells. We evaluated the mechanism of 3,6-DHF on the expression of tumor suppressor miR-34a by transfecting them with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 plasmid and TET1 siRNA in breast cancer cells. Methylation-specific PCR detected methylation of the miR-34a promoter. First, we found that 3,6-DHF promotes the expression of TET1 during carcinogen-induced breast carcinogenesis in MCF10A cells and in rats. 3,6-DHF also increased TET1 and 5hmC levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further study indicated that TET1 siRNA and pcDNA3/Myc-DNMT1 inhibited the 3,6-DHF reactivation effect on expression of miR-34a in breast cancer cells. Methylation-specific PCR assays indicated that TET1 siRNA and pcDNA3/Myc-DNMT1 inhibit the effect of 3,6-DHF on the demethylation of the miR-34a promoter.

Mean tumor roundness was also measured using in-house software. The median longest lesion dimension was 16 mm (range, 13 to 18 mm) in TNBCs and 13 mm (range, 10 to 16 mm) in fibroadenomas. In comparison to fibroadenomas, small TNBC tumors presented with a higher incidence of irregular shapes (66.9%), noncircumscribed margins (91.7%), hypoechoic echotexture (59.1%), posterior acoustic enhancement (65.2%), and associated features (24.4%). Most TNBCs were classified as BI-RADS category 4 (65.2%) or 5 (28.2%). The mean tumor roundness of small TNBCs was greater than that of fibroadenomas (60%??12% vs. 53%??13%). Multivariate analysis showed that older patient age, irregular shape, nonparallel orientation, posterior acoustic enhancement, associated features, a BI-RADS final assessment category of 4 or 5, and greater tumor roundness were significant independent factors indicative of TNBCs.

Singly and in combination, these toxicants may have contributed significantly to the increasing rates of breast cancer observed over the past several decades. Exposures early in development from gestation through adolescence and early adulthood are particularly of concern as they re-shape the program of genetic, epigenetic and physiological processes in the developing mammary system, leading to an increased risk for developing breast cancer. In the 8?years since we last published a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, hundreds of new papers have appeared supporting this link, and in this update, the evidence on this topic is more extensive and of better quality than that previously available. Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, as well as a better understanding of mechanisms linking toxicants with development of breast cancer, all reinforce the conclusion that exposures to these substances - many of which are found in common, everyday products and byproducts - may lead to increased risk of developing breast cancer.

A range of studies have postulated that patients' individually appraised significance of their breast is an important factor in the decision for or against breast reconstruction. This study explored the individually perceived significance of the breast among patients with and without breast reconstruction and its correlation with postoperative satisfaction. Ten patients without breast reconstruction, and ten patients with immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy participated in the study. The perceived importance of the breast and the pre-and postoperative esthetic satisfaction of the patients were obtained using an 11-point Likert scale. Qualitative interviews explored patients' views on the meaning of their breast and their experience after surgery. Patients who had decided for breast reconstruction rated the importance of their breast for femininity (p?=?0.004) and attractiveness (p?=?0.037) significantly higher than patients without reconstruction. The qualitative data provide evidence that the breast of a woman fulfills a variety of intrapsychic and interactional functions. Difficulties in integrating the reconstructed breast into the body image were reported. A high importance of the breast correlated significantly with a decrease in satisfaction with the breast after reconstruction (rs?=?-0.652, p?=?0.041). Patients who found their breast to be highly important were more likely to decide for a reconstruction.

Concern remains, however, given the proximity of the IMNs to the heart and the association between cardiac RT exposure and toxicity. The objective of the study was to evaluate rates of ischemic cardiac events (ICEs) and associated risk with treatment of the IMN region. The cardiac outcomes of 2126 patients treated with adjuvant breast RT or breast and nodal RT from 1984 to 2007 at a single institution were reviewed. The primary endpoint was an ICE following RT initiation. The association between IMN RT and ICEs was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Treatment with both IMN RT and 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy (CRT) began in 1997; therefore, subset analyses of patients with only 3D CRT were performed to minimize bias associated with improved treatment technique. The median follow-up period was 9.3?years. An ICE occurred in 87 patients (4.1%). No increased 10-year rate of ICEs was observed with IMN RT compared with no IMN RT in the total cohort (3.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4%-4.3%] vs 3.4% [95% CI, 1.5%-7.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; P=.73). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was noted in the 3D CRT-planned, left-sided disease subset (5.1% [95% CI, 1.8%-14.1%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 2.0%-8.0%]; HR, 1.18, P=.76). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for cardiac risk factor imbalances, no significantly increased hazard was noted with IMN RT (HR, 1.84; P=.28) in the 3D CRT-planned, left-sided disease subset. No statistically significant association between IMN RT and ICEs was demonstrated in a review of patients treated at a single institution from 1984 to 2007. Given the long natural history and low overall rate of ICEs, continued follow-up of this study, as well as additional studies in the 3D CRT era, is warranted to confirm these results.

29789760,"Skin cancers are the most common human malignancy with increasing incidence. Currently, surgery is standard of care treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers. However, brachytherapy is a growing modality in the management of skin cancers. Therefore, we aimed to assess the outcome of patients with non-melanoma skin cancers treated by high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy with surface mold technique. In this prospective study, we recruited patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin who were candidates for definitive or adjuvant brachytherapy during 2013-2014. Alginate was used for making the individualized surface molds for each patient. Patients were treated with afterloading radionuclide HDR brachytherapy machine, with a total dose of 30-52 Gy in 10-13 fractions. Participants were followed for 2 years for radiation toxicity, cosmetic results, and local failures. A total of 60 patients (66.7% male; median age, 71 years) were included, of which 42 (70.0%) underwent definitive radiotherapy. Seventy-five percent of lesions were BCC. The mean total dose was 39.6 ?? 5.4 Gy. Of patients in definitive group, 40/42 (95.2%) experienced complete clinical response after 3 months. The recurrence rate was 2/18 (11.11%) and 1/42 (2.38%) in adjuvant and definitive groups, respectively. The percentage of grade 3-4 acute (3-month post-treatment) and late toxicities (2 years post-treatment) was 6.7% and 0%, respectively. The cosmetic results were good/excellent in 96.2% of patients after 2 years of follow-up. With appropriate patient selection and choosing as lowest dose per fraction as possible, HDR brachytherapy with customized surface molds yields good oncological and cosmetic results for the treatment of localized skin BCC and SCC.",skin_neoplasms

BM are major causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. We describe a mixed population (data from both retrospective and prospective collection) having a BM from a solid tumor. We report the percentage distribution of the most frequent types of BM, confirming the data published in the literature. This paper may play a role in presenting the Southeast Asian reality compared with the Western countries. A tertiary-care cancer centre. Data for 4 years were retrieved from the records of the Department of Pathology of our institute. Hematolymphoid and meningeal tumors were excluded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained slides were reviewed, and in cases with an unknown primary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was advised. The panel of markers was chosen based on the histomorphology on H and E sections. IHC was done in cases with an unknown primary where paraffin blocks were available. Lung cancer was found to be the most common primary malignancy (n = 30; 48.4%) followed by breast cancer (n = 13; 21%), colorectal cancer (n = 6; 9.6%), and skin cancer (melanoma) [n = 3; 4.8%].

Among these aggressive lesions, sclerodermiform basal cell carcinomas are the most common type. This is a challenging-to-treat lesion due to its deep tissue invasion, rapid growth, risk of metastasis and overall poor prognosis if not diagnosed in early stages. To investigate if sclerodermiform basal cell carcinomas are diagnosed later compared to non-sclerodermiform basal cell carcinoma Method: All lesions excised from 2000 to 2010 were included. A pathologist classified the lesions in two cohorts: one with specimens of non-aggressive basal cell carcinoma (superficial, nodular and pigmented), and other with sclerodermiform basal cell carcinoma. For each lesion, we collected patient's information from digital medical records regarding: gender, age when first attending the clinic and the tumor location. 1256 lesions were included, out of which 296 (23.6%) corresponded to sclerodermiform basal cell carcinoma, whereas 960 (76.4%) were non-aggressive subtypes of basal cell carcinoma.

To evaluate the rate of adverse events after leg ulcers biopsy in 866 consecutive patients referring to our Wound Care Unit in Bologna from January 2008 to December 2016. Two biopsies were performed (from the border and the centre) by the same dermatologist following a standardized structured protocol. A total of 329 males and 537 females (ratio of 1:1.6), mean age 72 years (range 50-97 years) underwent a skin biopsy. Up to 70% of all analyses revealed a vascular ulcer (614 patients; 70.9%) while other conditions (252 patients; 29.1%) included inflammatory dermatitis, vasculitis, ulcerated neoplasms, infective lesions, post-traumatic and pressure sores, erosive pustular, dermatitis and pyoderma gangrenosum. Adverse events occurred in 322 patients (38.43% of all biopsies), mostly a dull pain (320 patients, 37%) that resolved within some hours. Five patients with vasculitis (0.6%) experienced a worsening of the lesion and another five patients (0.6%) developed erysipelas. Only two patients, on double antithrombotic therapy (0.23%), had intraoperative bleeding. No allergic reactions were detected.

29667726,"Infantile haemangiomas (previously known as strawberry birthmarks) are soft, raised swellings of the skin that occur in 3% to 10% of infants. These benign vascular tumours are usually uncomplicated and tend to regress spontaneously. However, when haemangiomas occur in high-risk areas, such as near the eyes, throat, or nose, impairing their function, or when complications develop, intervention may be necessary. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. To assess the effects of interventions for the management of infantile haemangiomas in children. We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED, LILACS, and CINAHL. We also searched five trials registries and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of all types of interventions, versus placebo, active monitoring, or other interventions, in any child with single or multiple infantile haemangiomas (IHs) located on the skin. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were clearance, a subjective measure of improvement, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were other measures of resolution; proportion of parents or children who consider there is still a problem; aesthetic appearance; and requirement for surgical correction. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. We included 28 RCTs, with a total of 1728 participants, assessing 12 different interventions, including lasers, beta blockers (e.g. propranolol, timolol maleate), radiation therapy, and steroids. Comparators included placebo, an active monitoring approach, sham radiation, and interventions given alone or in combination.Studies were conducted in a number of countries, including China, Egypt, France, and Australia. Participant age ranged from 12 weeks to 13.4 years. Most studies (23/28) included a majority of females and different types of IHs. Duration of follow-up ranged from 7 days to 72 months.We considered most of the trials as at low risk of random sequence generation, attrition bias, and selective reporting bias. Domains such as allocation concealment and blinding were not clearly reported in general. We downgraded evidence for issues related to risk of bias and imprecision.We report results for the three most important comparisons, which we chose on the basis of current use. Outcome measurement of these comparisons was at 24 weeks' follow-up.Oral propranolol versus placeboCompared with placebo, oral propranolol 3 mg/kg/day probably improves clinician-assessed clearance (risk ratio (RR) 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.22 to 65.34; 1 study; 156 children; moderate-quality evidence) and probably leads to a clinician-assessed reduction in mean haemangioma volume of 45.9% (95% CI 11.60 to 80.20; 1 study; 40 children; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in terms of short- or long-term serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.39; 3 studies; 509 children; low-quality evidence), nor in terms of bronchospasm, hypoglycaemia, or serious cardiovascular adverse events. The results relating to clearance and resolution for this comparison were based on one industry-sponsored study.Topical timolol maleate versus placeboThe chance of reduction of redness, as a measure of clinician-assessed resolution, may be improved with topical timolol maleate 0.5% gel applied twice daily when compared with placebo (RR 8.11, 95% CI 1.09 to 60.09; 1 study; 41 children;low-quality evidence). Regarding short- or long-term serious cardiovascular events, we found no instances of bradycardia (slower than normal heart rate) or hypotension in either group (1 study; 41 children; low-quality evidence). No other safety data were assessed, and clearance was not measured.Oral propranolol versus topical timolol maleateWhen topical timolol maleate (0.5% eye drops applied twice daily) was compared with oral propranolol (via a tablet taken once per day, at a 1.0 mg/kg dose), there was no evidence of a difference in haemangioma size (as a measure of resolution) when measured by the proportion of patients with a clinician-assessed reduction of 50% or greater (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.97; 1 study; 26 participants; low-quality evidence). Although there were more short- or long-term general adverse effects (such as severe diarrhoea, lethargy, and loss of appetite) in the oral propranolol group, there was no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 123.35; 1 study; 26 participants; very low-quality evidence). This comparison did not measure clearance.None of our key comparisons evaluated, at any follow-up, a subjective measure of improvement assessed by the parent or child; proportion of parents or children who consider there is still a problem; or physician-, child-, or parent-assessed aesthetic appearance. We found there to be a limited evidence base for the treatment of infantile haemangiomas: a large number of interventions and outcomes have not been assessed in RCTs.Our key results indicate that in the management of IH in children, oral propranolol and topical timolol maleate are more beneficial than placebo in terms of clearance or other measures of resolution, or both, without an increase in harms. We found no evidence of a difference between oral propranolol and topical timolol maleate with regard to reducing haemangioma size, but we are uncertain if there is a difference in safety. Oral propranolol is currently the standard treatment for this condition, and our review has not found evidence to challenge this. However, these results are based on moderate- to very low-quality evidence.The included studies were limited by small sample sizes and risk of bias in some domains. Future trials should blind personnel and participants; describe trials thoroughly in publications; and recruit a sufficient number of children to deduce meaningful results. Future trials should assess patient-reported outcomes, as well as objective outcomes of benefit, and should report adverse events comprehensively. Propranolol and timolol maleate require further assessment in RCTs of all types of IH, including those considered problematic, as do other lesser-used interventions and new interventions. All treatments should be compared against propranolol and timolol maleate, as beta blockers are approved as standard care.",skin_neoplasms

Surveillance in targeted publications was conducted through February 14, 2018. Studies included in previous USPSTF reports were reevaluated for inclusion. Fair- and good-quality studies of primary care-relevant behavioral interventions focused on improving skin cancer outcomes, intermediate outcomes, or skin cancer prevention and self-examination behaviors. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data into evidence tables. Results were qualitatively summarized but not pooled because of heterogeneity of measures. Skin cancer, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, sun protection behaviors, and any harms from interventions. Twenty-one trials in 27 publications were included (N?=?20?561). No studies assessed skin cancer outcomes in pediatric populations; 1 adult trial (n?=?1356) promoting skin self-examination found no significant difference in participants diagnosed with melanoma in the intervention group vs the control group at 12-month follow-up (0 vs 1 diagnosis). There was no consistent improvement in prevention of sunburn for children (3 trials [n?=?2508]) or adults (6 trials [n?=?3959]). There were small to moderate increases in sun protection behavior in pediatric populations (6 trials [n?=?4252]) and adults (12 trials [n?=?13?099]) and small increases in skin self-examination in adults (11 trials [n?=?7771]; odds ratios, 1.16-2.6). One of 3 trials of indoor tanning found an intervention effect; an appearance-focused intervention (n?=?430) resulted in a smaller increase in mean indoor tanning sessions at 6 months in the intervention group vs the control group.

29523502,"The incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than any other major cancer both in Brazil and worldwide. Southeast Brazil has especially high incidences of melanoma, and early detection is low. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a primary risk factor for developing melanoma. Increasing attractiveness is a major motivation among adolescents for tanning. A medical student-delivered intervention that takes advantage of the broad availability of mobile phones and adolescents' interest in their appearance indicated effectiveness in a recent study from Germany. However, the effect in a high-UV index country with a high melanoma prevalence and the capability of medical students to implement such an intervention remain unknown. In this pilot study, our objective was to investigate the preliminary success and implementability of a photoaging intervention to prevent skin cancer in Brazilian adolescents. We implemented a free photoaging mobile phone app (Sunface) in 15 secondary school classes in southeast Brazil. Medical students ""mirrored"" the pupils' altered 3-dimensional (3D) selfies reacting to touch on tablets via a projector in front of their whole grade accompanied by a brief discussion of means of UV protection. An anonymous questionnaire capturing sociodemographic data and risk factors for melanoma measured the perceptions of the intervention on 5-point Likert scales among 356 pupils of both sexes (13-19 years old; median age 16 years) in grades 8 to 12 of 2 secondary schools in Brazil. We measured more than 90% agreement in both items that measured motivation to reduce UV exposure and only 5.6% disagreement: 322 (90.5%) agreed or strongly agreed that their 3D selfie motivated them to avoid using a tanning bed, and 321 (90.2%) that it motivated them to improve their sun protection; 20 pupils (5.6%) disagreed with both items. The perceived effect on motivation was higher in female pupils in both tanning bed avoidance (n=198, 92.6% agreement in females vs n=123, 87.2% agreement in males) and increased use of sun protection (n=197, 92.1% agreement in females vs n=123, 87.2% agreement in males) and independent of age or skin type. All medical students involved filled in a process evaluation revealing that they all perceived the intervention as effective and unproblematic, and that all pupils tried the app in their presence. The photoaging intervention was effective in changing behavioral predictors for UV protection in Brazilian adolescents. The predictors measured indicated an even higher prospective effectiveness in southeast Brazil than in Germany (>90% agreement in Brazil vs >60% agreement in Germany to both items that measured motivation to reduce UV exposure) in accordance with the theory of planned behavior.

As a solution to facilitate reconstruction, skin banking of free-flap skin has been proposed in cases where the overlying skin envelope must be resected, as this technique spares the patient an additional donor site. Herein, we present the largest series to date in which this method was used. We investigated its safety and the possibility of skin banking for prolonged periods of time. All skin-sparing mastectomies and immediate autologous breast reconstructions from December 2009 until June 2013 at our institution were analysed. We identified 31 patients who underwent 33 free flap reconstructions in which skin banking was performed. Our median skin banking period was 7 days, with a maximum duration of 171 days. In 22.5% of cases, the banked skin was used to reconstruct overlying skin defects, and in 9.6% of cases to reconstruct the nipple-areolar complex. Microbiological and histological investigations of the banked skin revealed neither clinical infections nor malignancies. In situ skin banking, even for prolonged periods of time, is a safe and cost-effective method to ensure that skin defects due to necrosis or secondary oncological resection can be easily reconstructed.",skin_neoplasms

HPV16-induced skin lesions and their inflammatory infiltrates were studied histologically. COX2 expression was assessed immunohistochemically. Rutin reduced COX2 expression in the dermis (immunostaining score 7.83 versus 11.25 in untreated HPV16-transgenic mice) and epidermis (4.5 versus 10.0).

Human epidermal growth factor receptor gene-2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer represents about 20% of all breast cancers, 1 out of 10 is diagnosed in women over 70 years of age. It tends to be more aggressive and to spread more quickly than other subtypes, but the introduction in clinical practice of new anti-HER-2 agents combined with chemotherapy has significantly improved progression free and overall survival. Elderly patients are frequently undertreated because of concerns about their age, performance status, and comorbidities. Here, we report a case of an octogenarian patient treated with T-DM1 with brilliant results.

Although they are benign nevomelanocytic neoplasms, all CMN may be precursors of the melanoma, regardless of their size. Individual risk of malignant transformation of melanocyte is determined by simultaneous action of exogenous and endogenous factors. The major exogenous risk factor is ultraviolet radiation. Leading roles among the endogenous factors are attributed to skin phenotype, gene mutation, sex hormones and their significance. We present a case of a 27 - year - old pregnant female patient with a congenital melanocytic nevus, which increased significantly in size, during her pregnancy. Estrogen levels increase during pregnancy and clinical evidence has suggested that melanocytes are estrogen - responsive. Nevi in a pregnant patient would exhibit increased expression of estrogen receptor ?? (ER??) and thus enhanced the potential to respond to altered estrogen levels. All pigmented skin lesions should be carefully observed during pregnancy by a dermatologist due to the increased risk of malignant transformation, associated with the endocrine dependence.

We aimed to analyze the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence of the 6 cases of PLS. Six cases with confirmed pathological PLS presented at out hospital from January 2003 to January 2017. The postoperative pathology of 5 cases confirmed PLS, and the other was confirmed as PLS with well-differentiated liposarcoma. All 6 patients underwent complete tumor resection at the time of the first definite diagnosis, and one of them had underwent 3 cycles of chemotherapy treatment. There were 4 cases with local recurrence and surgery was repeated after the first radical excision. One case was not recurrent after 27 months post-operation, and the other was lost. The shortest recurrence time of all of these cases was 4 months, and the longest was 29 months after the first radical surgery. PLS is a rare and high-grade malignancy with high recurrence, poor prognosis, and its treatment is still highly controversial.

29448922,"Exposure to sunlight can have both positive and negative health impacts. Excessive exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause skin cancer, however insufficient exposure to sunlight has a detrimental effect on production of Vitamin D. In the construction industry there are onsite proactive behaviours for safety, but sun-safety remains a low priority. There is limited research on understanding the barriers to adopting sun-safe behaviours and the association this may have with Vitamin D production. This paper reports a protocol for an intervention study, using text messaging in combination with a supportive smartphone App. The intervention aims to both reduce UV exposure during months with higher UV levels and promote appropriate dietary changes to boost Vitamin D levels during months with low UV levels. Approximately 60 construction workers will be recruited across the United Kingdom. A randomised control crossover trial (RCCT) will be used to test the intervention, with randomisation at site level - i.e. participants will receive both the control (no text messages or supportive App support) and intervention (daily text messages and supportive App). Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) the intervention focuses on supporting sun-safety and healthy dietary decisions in relation to Vitamin D intake. The intervention emphasises cultivating the perception of normative support in the workplace, increasing awareness of control and self-efficacy in taking sun-protective behaviours, making healthier eating choices to boost Vitamin D, and tackling stigmas attached to image and group norms. Each study epoch will last 21?days with intervention text messages delivered on workdays only. The supportive App will provide supplementary information about sun protective behaviours and healthy dietary choices. The primary outcome measure is 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D [25(OH)D] level (obtained using blood spot sampling), which will be taken pre and post control and intervention periods. Secondary outcome measures are two-fold, (1) using the TPB to detect changes in behaviour, and (2) quantifying UV exposure during the UK peak radiation season (April-September) using body-mounted UV sensors. This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of a technology-based intervention to promote sun-safety and healthy behaviours in outdoor construction workers.

Moreover, surgery invariably leads to large defects requiring reconstructive surgery. Rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) and abdominal advancement flaps have an independent and constant blood supply, are easily harvested, and provide substantial skin coverage and soft tissue. To determine the surgical and oncological outcomes in patients with LAPSCC undergoing surgical resection with RAM flaps. From 2002 to 2016, a multi-institutional database identified 15 LAPSCC patients undergoing flap reconstructions. Local surgical resection with RAM or abdominal advancement flap reconstruction. Perioperative and pathologic data were collected. Postoperative complications were identified using the Clavien-Dindo classification for surgical complications. Fifteen patients (median age 61 yr) were treated, ten with curative intent. Thirteen patients received induction chemotherapy. Thirteen of the 15 patients (87%) experienced wound complications, including five Clavien-Dindo grade III complications. In 11/15 patients (73%), the disease recurred (median recurrence-free interval 106 d). The majority of recurrences (91%) were locoregional, and in four cases the patient also had lesions in distant organs. Ten of the 15 patients (67%) died of their disease. The overall median follow-up interval was 10.5 mo. The study was limited by its retrospective design, the absence of quality-of-life measurements, and the cohort size. The results of this study show that surgical resection with reconstruction is associated with a risk of perioperative complications, including high-grade Clavien-Dindo complications. With a cure rate of 27%, surgery must be carefully considered and there is a need for alternative treatments. Lack of robust quality-of-life-data is also a serious shortcoming in the decision process for this patient category. Surgery in locoregionally advanced penile cancer has a low cure rate. Reconstruction of defects is surgically feasible, albeit with a high risk of complications. Furthermore, decision-making lacks robust data on quality of life after surgery.",skin_neoplasms

Little is known about the genetic or molecular basis of SC. This study identifies the involvement of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in periocular SC. Fifteen patients with periocular SC patients were compared to 15 patients with eyelid nodular basal cell carcinoma (nBCC; a known Hh tumor), alongside four normal individuals as a control for physiological Hh expression. Expression of Patched 1 (PTCH1), Smoothened (SMO), and glioma-associated zinc transcription factors (Gli1 and Gli2) were assessed in histological sections using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques. Antibody specificity was verified using Western-blot analysis of a Gli1 over-expressed cancer cell line, LNCaP-Gli1. Semi-quantification compared tumors and control tissue using IF analysis by ImageJ software. Expression of the Hh pathway was observed in SC for all four major components of the pathway. PTCH1, SMO, and Gli2 were more significantly upregulated in SC (P?<?0.01) compared to nBCC. Stromal expression of PTCH1 and Gli2 was observed in SC (P?<?0.01). In contrast, stromal expression of these proteins in nBCC was similar or down-regulated compared to physiological Hh controls. The Hh signaling pathway is significantly more upregulated in periocular SC compared to nBCC, a known aberrant Hh pathway tumor. Furthermore, the stroma of the SC demonstrated Hh upregulation, in particular Gli2, compared to nBCC. Targeting of this pathway may be a potential treatment strategy for SC.",skin_neoplasms
29415335,"Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common type of melanoma in people with darker skin phototypes. There is some evidence that the aetiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and natural history of ALM differ from those of superficial spreading melanoma (SSM). ALM behaves more aggressively than SSM, but the biological explanation for these differences remains unknown. The presence of one subtype of macrophages, termed M2-macrophage (M2-M), has been found to be related to local progression, metastasis and poor prognosis in several neoplasms. The aim of this study was to compare the density of M2-Ms in ALMs versus SSMs, and to examine whether or not the density of M2-Ms is associated with histopathological features predictive of adverse prognosis in cutaneous melanoma (CM), as well as development of metastasis. Sixty-seven ALMs and 67 SSMs cases were analysed. The tumours were classified according to thickness, ulceration, mitosis and metastasis. M2-M quantity was evaluated using immunohistochemistry with anti-CD163 and anti-CD206 antibodies. M2-Ms were increased in ALM compared with SSM, and were related to the histopathological features predictive of adverse prognosis in CM, such as thickness > 1.0 mm, ulceration and mitotic activity, and the development of metastasis. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the increased presence of M2-Ms in ALM compared with SSM. Our findings suggest that the increased M2-Ms in ALM are associated with the main histopathological features predictive of adverse prognosis in CM, as well as the presence of metastasis, and that these cells can be related to the aggressive behaviour seen in ALMs.",skin_neoplasms
29409139,"Malignant melanoma, one of the most aggressive of all skin cancers, is increasing in incidence throughout the world. Surgery remains the cornerstone of curative treatment in earlier stages. Metastatic disease is incurable in most affected people, because melanoma does not respond to most systemic treatments. A number of novel approaches are under evaluation and have shown promising results, but they are usually associated with increased toxicity and cost. The combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been reported to improve treatment results, but it is still unclear whether evidence exists to support this choice, compared with chemotherapy alone. No language restrictions were imposed. To compare the effects of therapy with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (chemoimmunotherapy) versus chemotherapy alone in people with metastatic malignant melanoma. We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (14 February 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (2003 to 30 January 2006 ), EMBASE (2003 to 20 July 2005) and LILACS (1982 to 20 February 2006). References, conference proceedings, and databases of ongoing trials were also used to locate trials. All randomised controlled trials that compared the use of chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy on people of any age, diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Two authors independently assessed each study to determine whether it met the pre-defined selection criteria, with differences being resolved through discussion with the review team. Two authors independently extracted the data from the articles using data extraction forms. Quality assessment included an evaluation of various components associated with biased estimates of treatment effect. Whenever possible, a meta-analysis was performed on the extracted data, in order to calculate a weighed treatment effect across trials. Eighteen studies met our criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 2625 participants. We found evidence of an increase of objective response rates in people treated with chemoimmunotherapy, in comparison with people treated with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the impact of these increased response rates was not translated into a survival benefit. We found no difference in survival to support the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy in the systemic treatment of metastatic melanoma, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, P = 0.31). Additionally, we found increased hematological and non-hematological toxicities in people treated with chemoimmunotherapy. We failed to find any clear evidence that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy increases survival of people with metastatic melanoma.

Recently, new classes of drugs (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors and small-molecule targeted drugs) have significantly improved patient prognosis, which has drastically changed the landscape of melanoma therapeutic management. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2000. To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of systemic treatments for metastatic cutaneous melanoma. We searched the following databases up to October 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the ASCO database in February 2017, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We considered RCTs of systemic therapies for people with unresectable lymph node metastasis and distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma compared to any other treatment. We checked the reference lists of selected articles to identify further references to relevant trials. Two review authors extracted data, and a third review author independently verified extracted data. We implemented a network meta-analysis approach to make indirect comparisons and rank treatments according to their effectiveness (as measured by the impact on survival) and harm (as measured by occurrence of high-grade toxicity). The same two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies according to Cochrane standards and assessed evidence quality based on the GRADE criteria. We included 122 RCTs (28,561 participants). Of these, 83 RCTs, encompassing 21 different comparisons, were included in meta-analyses. Included participants were men and women with a mean age of 57.5 years who were recruited from hospital settings. Twenty-nine studies included people whose cancer had spread to their brains. Interventions were categorised into five groups: conventional chemotherapy (including single agent and polychemotherapy), biochemotherapy (combining chemotherapy with cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha), immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies), small-molecule targeted drugs used for melanomas with specific gene changes (such as BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors), and other agents (such as anti-angiogenic drugs). Most interventions were compared with chemotherapy. In many cases, trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies producing the tested drug: this was especially true for new classes of drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and small-molecule targeted drugs.When compared to single agent chemotherapy, the combination of multiple chemotherapeutic agents (polychemotherapy) did not translate into significantly better survival (overall survival: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16, 6 studies, 594 participants; high-quality evidence; progression-free survival: HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25, 5 studies, 398 participants; high-quality evidence. Those who received combined treatment are probably burdened by higher toxicity rates (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.71, 3 studies, 390 participants; moderate-quality evidence). (We defined toxicity as the occurrence of grade 3 (G3) or higher adverse events according to the World Health Organization scale.)Compared to chemotherapy, biochemotherapy (chemotherapy combined with both interferon-alpha and interleukin-2) improved progression-free survival (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99, 6 studies, 964 participants; high-quality evidence), but did not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, 7 studies, 1317 participants; high-quality evidence). Biochemotherapy had higher toxicity rates (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.61, 2 studies, 631 participants; high-quality evidence).With regard to immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies plus chemotherapy probably increased the chance of progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92, 1 study, 502 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but may not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.01, 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy alone, anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies is likely to be associated with higher toxicity rates (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.42, 2 studies, 1142 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Compared to chemotherapy, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors) improved overall survival (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.48, 1 study, 418 participants; high-quality evidence) and probably improved progression-free survival (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61, 2 studies, 957 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies may also result in less toxicity than chemotherapy (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, 3 studies, 1360 participants; low-quality evidence).Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies performed better than anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies in terms of overall survival (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.66, 1 study, 764 participants; high-quality evidence) and progression-free survival (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.60, 2 studies, 1465 participants; high-quality evidence). Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies may result in better toxicity outcomes than anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 2 studies, 1465 participants; low-quality evidence).Compared to anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone, the combination of anti-CTLA4 plus anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies was associated with better progression-free survival (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46, 2 studies, 738 participants; high-quality evidence). There may be no significant difference in toxicity outcomes (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.92, 2 studies, 764 participants; low-quality evidence) (no data for overall survival were available).The class of small-molecule targeted drugs, BRAF inhibitors (which are active exclusively against BRAF-mutated melanoma), performed better than chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57, 2 studies, 925 participants; high-quality evidence) and progression-free survival (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.34, 2 studies, 925 participants; high-quality evidence), and there may be no significant difference in toxicity (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.33, 2 studies, 408 participants; low-quality evidence).Compared to chemotherapy, MEK inhibitors (which are active exclusively against BRAF-mutated melanoma) may not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.25, 3 studies, 496 participants; low-quality evidence), but they probably lead to better progression-free survival (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80, 3 studies, 496 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, MEK inhibitors probably have higher toxicity rates (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.41, 1 study, 91 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Compared to BRAF inhibitors, the combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was associated with better overall survival (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82, 4 studies, 1784 participants; high-quality evidence). BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was also probably better in terms of progression-free survival (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.71, 4 studies, 1784 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and there appears likely to be no significant difference in toxicity (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20, 4 studies, 1774 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Compared to chemotherapy, the combination of chemotherapy plus anti-angiogenic drugs was probably associated with better overall survival (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81; moderate-quality evidence) and progression-free survival (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; moderate-quality evidence). There may be no difference in terms of toxicity (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.32; low-quality evidence). All results for this comparison were based on 324 participants from 2 studies.Network meta-analysis focused on chemotherapy as the common comparator and currently approved treatments for which high- to moderate-quality evidence of efficacy (as represented by treatment effect on progression-free survival) was available (based on the above results) for: biochemotherapy (with both interferon-alpha and interleukin-2); anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies; anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies; anti-CTLA4 plus anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies; BRAF inhibitors; MEK inhibitors, and BRAF plus MEK inhibitors. Analysis (which included 19 RCTs and 7632 participants) generated 21 indirect comparisons.The best evidence (moderate-quality evidence) for progression-free survival was found for the following indirect comparisons:? both combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.51) and small-molecule targeted drugs (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26) probably improved progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy;? both BRAF inhibitors (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68) and combinations of small-molecule targeted drugs (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.39) were probably associated with better progression-free survival compared to anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies;? biochemotherapy (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.76 to 4.51) probably lead to worse progression-free survival compared to BRAF inhibitors;? the combination of small-molecule targeted drugs probably improved progression-free survival (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68) compared to anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies;? both biochemotherapy (HR 5.05, 95% CI 3.01 to 8.45) and MEK inhibitors (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.65) were probably associated with worse progression-free survival compared to the combination of small-molecule targeted drugs; and? biochemotherapy was probably associated with worse progression-free survival (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.11) compared to the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors.The best evidence (moderate-quality evidence) for toxicity was found for the following indirect comparisons:? combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (RR 3.49, 95% CI 2.12 to 5.77) probably increased toxicity compared to chemotherapy;? combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors probably increased toxicity (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.20) compared to BRAF inhibitors;? the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors probably increased toxicity (RR 3.83, 95% CI 2.59 to 5.68) compared to anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies; and? biochemotherapy was probably associated with lower toxicity (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.71) compared to the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors.Network meta-analysis-based ranking suggested that the combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors is the most effective strategy in terms of progression-free survival, whereas anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies are associated with the lowest toxicity.Overall, the risk of bias of the included trials can be considered as limited. When considering the 122 trials included in this review and the seven types of bias we assessed, we performed 854 evaluations only seven of which (< 1%) assigned high risk to six trials. We found high-quality evidence that many treatments offer better efficacy than chemotherapy, especially recently implemented treatments, such as small-molecule targeted drugs, which are used to treat melanoma with specific gene mutations. Compared with chemotherapy, biochemotherapy (in this case, chemotherapy combined with both interferon-alpha and interleukin-2) and BRAF inhibitors improved progression-free survival; BRAF inhibitors (for BRAF-mutated melanoma) and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies improved overall survival. However, there was no difference between polychemotherapy and monochemotherapy in terms of achieving progression-free survival and overall survival. Biochemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival and has higher toxicity rates compared with chemotherapy.There was some evidence that combined treatments worked better than single treatments: anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies, alone or with anti-CTLA4, improved progression-free survival compared with anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone. Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies performed better than anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies in terms of overall survival, and a combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was associated with better overall survival for BRAF-mutated melanoma, compared to BRAF inhibitors alone.The combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors (which can only be administered to people with BRAF-mutated melanoma) appeared to be the most effective treatment (based on results for progression-free survival), whereas anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies appeared to be the least toxic, and most acceptable, treatment.Evidence quality was reduced due to imprecision, between-study heterogeneity, and substandard reporting of trials. Future research should ensure that those diminishing influences are addressed. Clinical areas of future investigation should include the longer-term effect of new therapeutic agents (i.e. immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies) on overall survival, as well as the combination of drugs used in melanoma treatment; research should also investigate the potential influence of biomarkers.",skin_neoplasms

Pathological examination of the resected specimen indicated Pagetoid growth of mucinous carcinoma, and it was positive for stump. Consequently, laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection was performed. Finally, the plaque was diagnosed as anal canal adenocarcinoma with Pagetoid growth, and all the previous results were deemed as initial diagnosis. Discriminating between primary and secondary Paget's disease, even with immunohistological techniques, is difficult. Novel methodology that might facilitatemoreaccuratediagnosis preoperatively for erythematous plaquearound theanus and morecurativethe rapeutic strategy are needed.",skin_neoplasms
29390581,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, is a rare and aggressive malignancy with frequent cutaneous involvement. Although cutaneous lesions are often chemosensitive, BPDCN portends a poor prognosis as most patients relapse after developing drug resistance. We report a case of a 65-year-old man who presented with a rapidly enlarging hyperpigmented plaque on his shoulder with subsequent similarly appearing macules and plaques on his chest, back, and neck. Skin biopsy revealed a dense adnexocentric dermal infiltrate of immature blastoid cells without epidermal involvement. The infiltrate was immunoreactive for CD4, CD56, CD123, and Bcl-2, but negative for CD3, CD8, CD30, MPO, EBER, and ISH. The patient was diagnosed with BPDCN based on these cell markers. Bone marrow biopsy and radiologic work-up showed no evidence of extracutaneous involvement. The patient attained partial remission after undergoing 2 rounds of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP regimen) before autologous stem cell transplantation, however, he quickly relapsed and developed new cutaneous lesions. The patient was treated with venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, and exhibits complete resolution of prior skin findings and continues to remain free of new cutaneous lesions 10 months posttreatment initiation with venetoclax. Herein, we present a case that supports the use of venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, in the off-label treatment of BPDCN with Bcl-2 overexpression. Only 1 prior case has reported the off-label use of venetoclax for the treatment of BPDCN. This case highlights a novel therapeutic option for BPDCN patients unresponsive to traditional treatment.",skin_neoplasms

Here, we report 2 cases of KS associated with Koebner phenomenon and the correlation of human herpesvirus 8 molecular analysis with the clinical outcome. In the first case, a patient with a history of sporadic cutaneous KS developed a recurrent lesion at the laryngeal tract, the site of a previous nodulectomy. In our second case, immunodeficiency induced by chemotherapy triggered the development of KS and Koebner phenomenon was limited to the skin at the site of safenectomy. Our observations suggest that careful planning of surgical treatment is required in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with a medical history of KS.

29384887,"Chondroid syringoma (CS) occurs mostly on the face and neck, and rarely occurs in the toe. Malignant CS is invasive, grows quickly, and has a high recurrence rate. The presence of a bilobed CS in 1 toe has never been reported in the literature. A 72-year-old male patient presented with a mass in a third toe of his right foot. The mass had slowly grown in 2 years. He felt mild pain and the mass occupied most of the tip of the toe. Radiographs showed a large soft-tissue mass in the third toe of his right foot without any bone destruction. Ultrasonogram showed 2 partly fused hypoechoic masses within the lesion. The mass was therefore diagnosed as a benign CS. We amputated the toe with the mass under local anesthesia. The postoperative pathohistological examinations confirmed that the lesion was a bipartite CS exhibiting active cellular proliferation. Two years after surgery, there was no tumor recurrence. CS can also present as multiple adjacent masses. Complete surgical resection and long-term follow-up are essential.",skin_neoplasms
29376219,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer. To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions:1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans. We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants. We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,444 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk.Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed.In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender.We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation. Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding.Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.",skin_neoplasms
29374702,"Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been extensively applied in the field of dermatology and aesthetics; however, the long-term consequences of its use are poorly unknown, and to the best of our knowledge there is no study on the effect of IPL in neoplastic lesions. In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying IPL application in the skin, we used an animal model of carcinogenesis obtained by chemical induction with 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were administered DMBA and/or TPA and treated with IPL. Skin was evaluated by histopathology and 2DE-blot-MS/MS analysis. Our data evidenced an inflammatory response and a metabolic remodeling of skin towards a glycolytic phenotype after chronic exposure to IPL, which was accomplished by increased oxidative stress and susceptibility to apoptosis. These alterations induced by IPL were more notorious in the DMBA sensitized skin. Keratins and metabolic proteins seem to be the more susceptible to oxidative modifications that might result in loss of function, contributing for the histological changes observed in treated skin. Data highlight the deleterious impact of IPL on skin phenotype, which justifies the need for more experimental studies in order to increase our understanding of the IPL long-term safety.",skin_neoplasms

From November 2014 to October 2016, 11 patients were indicated to undergo, and nine of them were submitted to single-port hysterectomy using da Vinci Single-Site? platform. However, in two patients, due to multiple previous abdominal surgeries, large uterine volume, and/or a uterus with no mobility, a pneumoperitoneum was performed with a Verres needle, and the pelvic cavity was assessed using a 5mm optics endoscope. In these cases, single-port surgery was not recommended; therefore, multiportal robotic access was chosen, and no intercurrent events were reported. Nine single-port cases were operated on by the same surgeon at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. Patient data analyzed included age, body mass index, previous surgeries, and clinical diagnosis. Surgical data included operative time, skin incision, report of intraoperative complications, need for conversion to laparotomy, need for transfer to intensive care unit, need for blood transfusion, inadvertent injury to other organs, length of hospital stay, and death. All cases were completed with da Vinci Single-Site? system, with no intercurrent events. Four patients presented with adenomyosis as the surgical indication, two had uterine myoma, one endometrial cancer, one endometrial polyp, and one desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. The mean age of patients was 44 years (range, 40 to 54 years), and body mass index varied between 23.4 and 33.2kg/m2 (mean 26.4).

This work assesses its impact for local irradiation in terms of side effects, as well as tumour control in locally advanced (LABC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We retrospectively reviewed data of 66 patients with LABC and MBC. Patients received standard fractionated radiotherapy by HT, with or without concurrent systemic treatment. The median age was 60 years (28-77). The median follow-up of the population was 35.9 months (10.6-95.8). For 91% of patients, HT was concomitant with systemic treatments. Three patients experienced grade 3 skin toxicity and all had concurrent 5FU-vinorelbine. One patient who was receiving concurrent treatment with trastuzumab-pertuzumab had a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction by 14%. No late cardiac or lung toxicity was observed. A clinical benefit was observed in 75% of cases. At 2 months after HT, we observed tumour regression in 7/8 patients, as following: 1 complete, 4 partial responses, and 2 stable disease. The median survival for MBC group was 64.4 months (42.6-65.8) and 21.1 (6.1-36.1) months for LABC. This study suggests that the use of HT is well tolerated and feasible with a multimodal strategy that includes concurrent systemic treatments for patients with LABC and MBC.

29349539,"Surgical site infection (SSI) prevention bundles include the simultaneous use of different measures, which individually have demonstrated an effect on prevention of SSI. The implementation of bundles can yield superior results to the implementation of individual measures. The aim of this study was to address the effect of the application of a bundle including intraperitoneal lavage with antibiotic solution, fascial closure with Triclosan-coated sutures and Mupirocin ointment application on the skin staples, on the surgical site infection after elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. A prospective, randomized study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective laparoscopic surgery. The patients were randomized into two groups: those patients following standard bundles (Group 1) and those ones following the experimental bundle with three additional measures, added to the standard bundle. Incisional and organ space SSI were investigated. The study was assessor-blinded. A total of 198 patients were included in the study, 99 in each group. The incisional SSI rate was 16% in Group 1 and 2% in Group 2 [p?=?0.007; RR?=?5.6; CI 95% (1.4-17.8)]. The organ-space SSI rate was 4% in Group 1 and 0% in Group 2 [p?=?0.039; RR?=?1.7; CI 95% (1.1-11.6)]. Median hospital stay was 5.5 days in Group 1 and 4 days in Group 2 (p?=?0.028). The addition of intraperitoneal lavage with antibiotic solution, fascial closure with Triclosan-coated sutures and Mupirocin ointment application on the skin staples, to a standard bundle of SSI prevention, reduces the incisional and organ-space SSI and consequently the hospital stay, after elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03081962).",skin_neoplasms
29343242,"In this study, we compared stage at diagnosis, standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of most frequent cancer diagnoses between re-settlers (Aussiedler) from the former Soviet Union and the general population in the Saarland in Germany to assess possible delays in diagnosis of cancer among this migrant group. Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the Saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state's cancer registry. Vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate SIR and SMR in comparison to the autochthonous population. Tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. Odds ratios (OR) for an advanced tumor stage were modeled in dependence of re-settler-status and relevant covariates by logistic regression. Missing values were addressed in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of duration of stay in Germany on advanced stage diagnosis was analyzed among re-settlers. SIR and SMR of lung and breast cancer were lower among female re-settlers, while SIR and SMR of colorectal and prostate cancer were lower among male re-settlers. SIR and SMR of stomach cancer were elevated among both sexes. Female re-settlers showed an elevated OR for being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer. Both male and female re-settlers showed an elevated OR when observing all six sites combined (OR among males 1.47, p?=?0.04; OR among females 1.37, p?=?0.05). The result of elevated ORs was supported in the sensitivity analysis. Finally, male re-settlers showed a weak association between duration of stay in Germany and reduced risk for advanced stage diagnosis. Re-settlers were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. These findings are in line with previous research having shown unfavorable health care utilization of re-settlers. Overall, low mortality rates despite an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis argue for a sufficient follow-up care, comparable to the autochthonous population.",skin_neoplasms

We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence from all randomised trials. To determine the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib as first-line, second-line or maintenance treatment for advanced NSCLC. We performed searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 17 February 2017. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, clinical trial registries and references lists of retrieved articles. We included trials assessing gefitinib, alone or in combination with other treatment, compared to placebo or other treatments in the first- or successive-line treatment of patients with NSCLC, excluding compassionate use. We used the standard Cochrane methodology. Two authors independently assessed the search results to select those with sound methodological quality. We carried out all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We recorded the following outcome data: overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity, tumour response and quality of life. We also collected data for the following subgroups: Asian ethnicity and positive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. We included 35 eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which examined 12,089 patients.General populationGefitinib did not statistically improve overall survival when compared with placebo or chemotherapy in either first- or second-line settings. Second-line gefitinib prolonged time to treatment failure (TTF) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.90, P < 0.0001) when compared with placebo. Maintenance gefitinib improved progression-free survival (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91, P = 0.007) after first-line therapy.Studies in patients of Asian ethnicity or that conducted subgroup analysesSecond-line gefitinib prolonged overall survival over placebo (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P = 0.01). In the first-line setting, progression-free survival was improved with gefitinib over chemotherapy alone (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.98, P = 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Gefitinib given in combination with a chemotherapy regimen improved progression-free survival versus either gefitinib alone or chemotherapy alone (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96, P = 0.03; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.77, P < 0.00001, respectively). In the second-line setting, progression-free survival was superior in patients given gefitinib over placebo or chemotherapy (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91, P = 0.009; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88, P = 0.002; moderate quality of evidence, respectively). Combining gefitinib with chemotherapy in the second-line setting was superior to gefitinib alone (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, P = 0.04). As maintenance therapy, gefitinib improved progression-free survival when compared with placebo (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.54, P < 0.00001).Patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumoursStudies in patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumours showed an improvement in progression-free survival in favour of gefitinib over first-line and second-line chemotherapy (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61, P < 0.00001; HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47, P < 0.0001, respectively). Gefitinib as maintenance therapy following chemotherapy improved overall and progression-free survival (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98, P = 0.05; HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, P < 0.0001, respectively) in one phase III study when compared to placebo.Toxicities from gefitinib included skin rash, diarrhoea and liver transaminase derangements. Toxicities from chemotherapy included anaemia, neutropenia and neurotoxicity.In terms of quality of life, gefitinib improved Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) (standardised mean difference (SMD) 10.50, 95% CI 9.55 to 11.45, P < 0.000001), lung cancer subscale (SMD 3.63, 95% CI 3.08 to 4.19, P < 0.00001) and Trial Outcome Index (SMD 9.87, 95% CI 1.26 to 18.48, P < 0.00001) scores when compared with chemotherapy. This systematic review shows that gefitinib, when compared with standard first- or second-line chemotherapy or maintenance therapy, probably has a beneficial effect on progression-free survival and quality of life in selected patient populations, particularly those with tumours bearing sensitising EGFR mutations.Patients with EGFR mutations lived longer when given maintenance gefitinib than those given placebo.One study conducted subgroup analysis and showed that gefitinib improved overall survival over placebo in the second-line setting in patients of Asian ethnicity. All other studies did not detect any benefit on overall survival. The data analysed in this review were very heterogenous. We were limited in the amount of data that could be pooled, largely due to variations in study design. The risk of bias in most studies was moderate, with some studies not adequately addressing potential selection, attrition and reporting bias. This heterogeneity may have an impact on the applicability of the resultsCombining gefitinib with chemotherapy appears to be superior in improving progression-free survival to either gefitinib or chemotherapy alone, however further data and phase III studies in these settings are required.Gefitinib has a favourable toxicity profile when compared with current chemotherapy regimens. Although there is no improvement in overall survival, gefitinib compares favourably with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations with a prolongation of progression-free survival and a lesser side effect profile.",skin_neoplasms

A 57-year-old woman presented with an inguinal lymphadenopathy. Sixteen years before, cutaneous malignant melanoma of the lower limb had been excised. Needle aspiration revealed abundant neoplastic single cells as well as numerous multinucleated OGCs. Occasional neoplastic giant cells were also present. Nuclei of OGCs were monomorphic with oval morphology and were smaller than those of melanoma cells. The immunophenotype of OGCs (S100-, HMB45-, Melan-A-, SOX10-, Ki67-, CD163-, BRAF-, CD68+, MiTF+, p16+) was the expected for reactive OGCs of monocyte/macrophage origin. The tumor has shown an aggressive behavior with further metastases to the axillary lymph nodes and oral cavity. Numerous OGCs are a rare and relevant finding in malignant melanoma.

Besides their high anti-proliferative activity, some severe long-term side effects have been observed, for example genotoxicity and mutagenicity, likely strictly related to the formation of crosslinks. It has been demonstrated that blue light (BL) activation of 8-methoxypsoralen, an FDA-approved drug, leads to less mutagenic monoadducts in the DNA. So far, in this work the less toxic and more penetrating BL is proposed to activate 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA), an already known UVA photoactivatable compound. 2 of BL.

TMA showed high anti-proliferative activity on DU145 cells through induction of apoptosis. Besides ROS generation, the proapoptotic effect seemed to be related to activation of p38 and inhibition of p44/42 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the decrease in nuclear ??-catenin was coupled with a significant dropping of CD44-positive cells.

Patient medical history revealed that the mass was initially the size of a soybean and gradually grew over 3 years to the size of a fist. Histopathological examination of the tumors revealed that one was a basal cell carcinoma and the other a sebaceous gland carcinoma. The two cases of giant malignant eyelid tumors were surgically excised using rapid frozen section margin control. Different pedicle myocutaneous flaps were used to repair the orbital skin defects. Postoperative follow-up showed perfect healing of the pedicle flaps and good patient compliance. The results of these cases indicate that covering exposed orbital cavities with co",skin_neoplasms

We examined the efficacy and safety of adding chemotherapy to Regorafenib for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) patients. We recruited mCRC patients at our institute who received either regorafenib monotherapy or regorafenib in combination with other chemotherapies. All patients had received chemo and target therapies and presented with disease progression before regorafenib treatment. The primary end point was overall survival. Between September1, 2015 and May 31, 2017, 100 mCRC patients at our institute received regorafenib treatment. 39 patients were excluded due to poor performance, lack of timely treatment, or inadequate clinical data. A total of 34 patients received regorafenib combined with other chemotherapies, and 27 patients received regorafenib alone. Median follow up time was 10.4 and 6.1 months, respectively. The primary end point of median OS was higher in the combination group than in the single use group (20.9m vs 10.3m, p = 0.015). The most frequent adverse events were hand-foot skin reactions(16[47.1%]vs 12[44.4%]), fatigue(6[17.6%] vs 7[25.9%]), gastrointestinal discomfort (7[20.6%] vs 6[22.2%]), neutropenia (4[11.8%] vs 1[3.7%]), diarrhea(4[11.8%] vs 1[3.7%]), and mucositis(5[14.7%] vs 1[3.7%]). The present study showed the efficacy and side effects of regorafenib combination treatment. Superiority in median OS and median PFS was noted in the combination group.

While communicable diseases continue to burden low- and low-middle-income countries, non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on malignancies in low- and middle-income countries, specifically in Africa, suggest a higher mortality compared to other regions of the world, a difference partially explained by limited availability of screening and early detection systems as well as poorer access to treatment. To evaluate the diagnosed tumor burden in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and review literature on existing and suspected barriers to accessing appropriate oncologic care. This is a retrospective study carried out at Healthcare, Education, community Action, and Leadership development Africa, a 197-bed tertiary referral hospital, in the Province of North Kivu, along the eastern border of the DRC from 2012 to 2015. Patient charts were reviewed for diagnoses of presumed malignancy with biopsy results. A total of 252 cases of suspected cancer were reviewed during the study period; 39.7% were men. The average age of patients was 43?years. Amongst adult patients, the most common presenting condition involved breast lesions with 5.8% diagnosis of fibrocystic breast changes and 2.9% invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. 37.3% of female patients had lesions involving the cervix or uterus. The most common diagnosis amongst male adults was prostate disease (16.7% of men). For pediatric patients, the most common diagnoses involved bone and/or cartilage (27.3%) followed by skin and soft tissue lesions (20.0%). All patients underwent surgical resection of lesions; some patients were advised to travel out of country for chemotherapy and radiation for which follow-up data are unavailable. Adequate and timely treatment of malignancy in the DRC faces a multitude of challenges.

Basaloid follicular hamartomas (BFHs) constitute rare neoplasms that can be detected in sporadic and familial settings as in the Basaloid Follicular Hamartoma Syndrome (BFHS). Although BFHS shares clinical, histopathological and genetic overlapping with the NBCCS, they are still considered two distinctive entities. The aim of our single-institution study was the analysis of a cohort of PTCH1-mutated patients in order to define clinical and biomolecular relationship between NBCCS and BFHs. In our study we evaluated PTCH1 gene-carrier probands affected by NBCCS to detect the incidence of BFHs and their correlation with this rare syndrome. Among probands we recognized 4 patients with BFHs. We found 15 germline PTCH1 mutations, uniformly distributed across the PTCH1 gene. Six of them had familial history of NBCCS, two of them were novel and have not been described previously. NBCCS and BFHS may be the same genetic entity and not two distinctive syndromes.

Critical challenges related to soft tissue stereotactic pelvic navigation include the potential difference in patient anatomy between intraoperative lithotomy and preoperative supine position for imaging. The objective of this study was to determine the difference in patient anatomy, sacral tilt, and skin fiducial position between these different patient positions and to investigate the feasibility and optimal set-up for stereotactic pelvic navigation. Four consecutive human anatomical specimens were submitted to repeated CT-scans in a supine and several degrees of lithotomy position. Patient anatomy, sacral tilt, and skin fiducial position were compared by means of an image computing platform. In two specimens, a 10-degree wedge was introduced to reduce the natural tilt of the sacrum during the shift from supine to lithotomy position. A simulation of laparoscopic and transanal surgical procedures was performed to assess the accuracy of the stereotactic navigation. An up-to-supracentimetric change in patient anatomy was noted between different patient positions. This observation was minimized through the application of a wedge. When switching from supine to another position, sacral retroversion occurred independent of the use of a wedge. There was considerable skin fiducial motion between different positions. Accurate stereotactic navigation was obtained with the least registration error (1.9?mm) when the position of the anatomical specimen was registered in a supine position with straight legs, without pneumoperitoneum, using a conventional CT-scan with an identical specimen positioning. The change in patient anatomy is small during the sacral tilt induced by positional changes when using a 10-degree wedge, allowing for an accurate stereotactic surgical navigation. This opens up new promising opportunities to increase the quality of surgery for rectal cancer cases where it is difficult or impossible to identify and dissect along the anatomical planes.",skin_neoplasms

BRAF-mutated melanoma patients were the most common, representing 70% of the study population, while NRAS- and C-KIT-mutated melanoma represented 19% and 11% respectively. BRAF-mutated melanomas were mostly located at sites of intermittent sun exposure, and were associated with higher Breslow thickness and an increased number of mitosis. NRAS mutated melanoma were mainly observed in chronic sun-damaged areas and had a negative prognostic value, with shorter time to progression and a high incidence of central nervous system involvement. C-KIT mutated melanoma were located at acral and mucosal sites. Overall survival observed in the three groups of patients revealed wide differences.

Therefore we aimed to describe men's attitudes, beliefs and experiences of prostate cancer screening. Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies on men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening. Electronic databases and reference lists were searched to October 2016. Sixty studies involving 3,029 men aged from 18-89 years, who had been screened for prostate cancer by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) or Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) and not screened, across eight countries were included. Five themes were identified: Social prompting (trusting professional opinion, motivation from family and friends, proximity and prominence of cancer); gaining decisional confidence (overcoming fears, survival imperative, peace of mind, mental preparation, prioritising wellbeing); preserving masculinity (bodily invasion, losing sexuality, threatening manhood, medical avoidance); avoiding the unknown and uncertainties (taboo of cancer-related death, lacking tangible cause, physiological and symptomatic obscurity, ambiguity of the procedure, confusing controversies); and prohibitive costs. Men are willing to participate in prostate cancer screening to prevent cancer and gain reassurance about their health, particularly when supported or prompted by their social networks or healthcare providers. However, to do so they needed to mentally overcome fears of losing their masculinity and accept the intrusiveness of screening, the ambiguities about the necessity and the potential for substantial costs.

The application of double reader concordance evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets in retrospective settings and its potential application to telemedicine evaluation has not been tested in a large study population. To improve diagnostic sensitivity of RCM image diagnosis using a double reader concordance evaluation approach; to reduce mismanagement of equivocal cutaneous lesions in retrospective consultation and telemedicine settings. 1000 combined dermoscopy-RCM image sets were evaluated in blind by 10 readers with advanced training and internship in dermoscopy and RCM evaluation. We compared sensitivity and specificity of single reader evaluation versus double reader concordance evaluation as well as the effect of diagnostic confidence on lesion management in a retrospective setting. Single reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 76.3%, with misdiagnosis of 8 melanomas, 4 basal cell carcinomas and 2 squamous cell carcinomas. Combined double reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 65.5%, with misdiagnosis of 1 in-situ melanoma and 2 basal cell carcinomas. Evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets of cutaneous lesions by single reader evaluation in retrospective settings is limited by sensitivity levels that may result in potential mismanagement of malignant lesions.

Patients were stratified according to randomising centre, ECOG performance status, previous transarterial chemoembolisation, and presence of macroscopic vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib or underwent at least one of the SIRT work-up exams. This study has been completed and the final results are reported here. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482442. Between Dec 5, 2011, and March 12, 2015, 467 patients were randomly assigned; after eight patients withdrew consent, 237 were assigned to SIRT and 222 to sorafenib. In the SIRT group, 53 (22%) of 237 patients did not receive SIRT; 26 (49%) of these 53 patients were treated with sorafenib. Median follow-up was 27?9 months (IQR 21?9-33?6) in the SIRT group and 28?1 months (20?0-35?3) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 8?0 months (95% CI 6?7-9?9) in the SIRT group versus 9?9 months (8?7-11?4) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio 1?15 [95% CI 0?94-1?41] for SIRT vs sorafenib; p=0?18). In the safety population, at least one serious adverse event was reported in 174 (77%) of 226 patients in the SIRT group and in 176 (82%) of 216 in the sorafenib group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (20 [9%] vs 41 [19%]), liver dysfunction (25 [11%] vs 27 [13%]), increased laboratory liver values (20 [9%] vs 16 [7%]), haematological abnormalities (23 [10%] vs 30 [14%]), diarrhoea (three [1%] vs 30 [14%]), abdominal pain (six [3%] vs 14 [6%]), increased creatinine (four [2%] vs 12 [6%]), and hand-foot skin reaction (one [<1%] vs 12 [6%]). 19 deaths in the SIRT group and 12 in the sorafenib group were deemed to be treatment related.

Imaging was available in 35. The medical records, photographs, and radiology studies of these patients were reviewed. All patients presented at less than 4 months of age (M:F, 13:21). 19 (55)% of tumors were on the left and were bilateral in 2 patients. The majority (29 patients) presented due to localized swelling or palpable mass; the remainder had a cutaneous lesion, but no palpable mass at the time of presentation. The referring diagnosis was incomplete or incorrect in 9 patients (26%). The imaging studies all demonstrated a well-defined homogeneous mass, with no abnormality of the surrounding subcutaneous fat. Sonography showed a uniformly vascular lesion with pulsatile fast-flow seen on Doppler. On MRI, the lesion was hyperintense on T2-weighted images, isointense on T1, with intense enhancement post-contrast. Oral therapy (propranolol or corticosteroids) was prescribed in 15 (45%). Follow-up in 28 patients demonstrated stability of the lesion in 11, regression in size in 11 and complete involution in 6. After involution 2 patients underwent resection of residual tissue and/or excess skin. Typical clinical presentation alone may be adequate to establish a diagnosis of parotid infantile hemangioma. However, in patients with no overlying cutaneous lesion, imaging can play a critical role in confirming the diagnosis. The sonographic findings are sufficiently characteristic to allow for a definitive diagnosis, obviating the need for further investigations. If diagnostic uncertainty remains or the full extent of the lesion cannot be appreciated, then MRI should be preferred over CT to avoid ionizing radiation.",skin_neoplasms

The patients were submitted to a complete ophthalmologic examination, gray-scale and Doppler ultrasonography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Lesion regression was evaluated clinically and radiologically during follow-up. The sample consisted of potentially amblyogenic and disfiguring lesions. The dose was increased at weekly intervals, from 0.5?mg to 3?mg/kg/day. The age at onset of treatment was 2-28?months. Follow-up lasted up to 48?months. Nine infants with periocular IH were treated with propranolol (oral) for 2-12?months (mean: 7.1?months). Clinical regression (attenuation of color and reduction in size) was observed in 88% during the first days of treatment. Partial recurrence was observed during follow-up in a patient treated for 6?months. On Doppler ultrasonography, during the first 6?months of treatment lesion volume and vascular density decreased while the arterial resistivity index (RI) increased, followed by a decline.

29075936,"Axillary node dissection has a central role in the surgical management of breast cancer; however, it is associated with a significant risk of lymphoedema and chronic pain. Peri-operative administration of local anesthesia reduces acute and persistent post-surgical pain, but there is currently no consensus on the optimal method of local anesthetic delivery. Patients undergoing axillary dissection for breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive a one-off dose of levobupivacaine 0.5% (up to 2?mg/kg) following surgery, either via the surgical drain or by direct skin infiltration. Post-operative pain control at rest and on shoulder abduction was assessed using a numerical rating scale. Total analgesia consumption 48?h after surgery was also recorded. Pain scores were significantly lower when local anesthesia was administered via surgical drain at both 3 and 12?h after surgery; this trend extended to 24?h post-operatively. However, pain scores on shoulder abduction did not differ at the 12 or 24 h time points. No differences were found in the total analgesia consumption or length of hospital stay between treatment groups. This study demonstrates that local anesthetic delivery via a surgical drain provides improved pain control compared to direct skin infiltration following axillary node dissection.

The coexistence of glucagonoma syndrome (GS) and SOA is a rare clinical condition and has not yet been reported. Additionally, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), a hallmark clinical sign of GS, is often misdiagnosed as other skin lesions by clinicians due to their lack of related knowledge, which delays diagnosis of GS and thus exacerbates the prognosis. A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our department because he presented with diabetes mellitus and a recurrent ulcerated skin rash. Prior to the accurate diagnosis, the skin manifestation was considered to be diabetic dermopathy. The patient's fasting serum glucagon level was up to 871.5?pg/mL. A biopsy of the pancreatic tumor revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and immunoperoxidase staining revealed glucagon-positive cells. In addition, the histological examination of the pancreatic cystic lesions showed typical features of SOA. The patient received a pancreaticoduodenal resection and radiofrequency ablation for the hepatic nodular lesion. One week after surgery, the glucagon concentration decreased to near normal levels. The cutaneous lesions spontaneously resolved within 4 weeks after surgery. Because almost all glucagonomas are malignant or have malignant potential, their early recognition and correct diagnosis are very important for a better prognosis, especially in cases with NME as the only manifestation during the development of glucagonomas.

Risk of skin cancer was analyzed using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and, for SCC, multivariable Poisson regression analysis of SIR ratios, adjusting for 5-year time period of transplantation, different follow-up time, age, sex, and type of organ. The study cohort included 8026 organ transplant recipients, 5224 men (65.1%), with a mean age at transplantation of 48.5 years. Median follow-up time was 6.7 years per recipient; total follow-up time, 69?590 person-years.

Adjusting for different follow-up times and background population risks, as well as age, graft organ, and sex, a decline in the SIR for SCC was found, with SIR peaking in patients who underwent transplantation in the 1983-1987 period and later declining to less than half in patients who underwent transplantation in the 1998-2002, 2003-2007, and 2008-2012 periods, with the relative SIRs being 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32-0.55), 0.31 (95% CI, 0.22-0.42), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.30-0.66), respectively. The risk of SCC after organ transplantation has declined significantly since the mid-1980s in Norway. Less aggressive and more individualized immunosuppressive treatment and close clinical follow-up may explain the decline.

Clinical lesion size and area, LM and LMM area based on HRCM-RV findings, surgical defect area estimated by HRCM-RV, and observed surgical defect area. In addition, the margins measured in millimeters estimated for tumor clearance in each quadrant based on HRCM-RV findings were calculated and compared with the surgical margins. Among the 22 patients (12 men and 10 women; mean [SD] age, 69.0 [8.6] years [range, 46-83 years]) with 23 lesions included in the final analysis, the mean (SD) surgical defect area estimated with HRCM-RV was 6.34 (4.02) cm2 and the mean (SD) area of surgical excision with clear margins was 7.74 (5.28) cm2. Overall, controlling for patient age and previous surgery, surgical margins were a mean of 0.76 mm (95% CI, 0.67-0.84 mm; P?<?.001) larger than the HRCM-RV estimate. Mapping of LM and LMM with HRCM-RV estimated defects that were similar to but slightly smaller than those found in staged excision.

For HfB, an intraoperative boost of 10?Gy was delivered using 4-7 cm applicators with energies from 4 to 12?MeV followed by whole-breast radiation with 40.5?Gy over 15 fractions. Toxicity was assessed at 2?weeks, 6?months, and 12?months per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute skin toxicity criteria and cosmesis. At 12?months, SF and HfB were well tolerated by all patients with no Grade 3+?toxicity. At 1?year, Grade-2 toxicity was resolved. Ninety-eight percent of SF patients and ninety percent of HfB patients had 0-1 grade toxicity. In the SF and HfB groups, 100% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis at 12-month followup interval. The SF exhibited a more favorable cosmesis with a higher percentage of excellent scores compared with HfB (80.4% vs. 45%; p?= 0.0033).

We purposed to analyse the clinical follow-up of individuals carrying constitutional mutations in the MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6 genes who were unaffected by benign polyps or malignant tumours at diagnosis. Mut?+?subjects (n.81) were members of Lynch syndromes in whom mutations were detected between 1993 and 2015; all were asymptomatic at diagnosis. They were informed of the cancer risk and surveillance was suggested. As controls, 113 nongene carriers (Mut-) in the same Lynch families were identified. About one-fourth of the mutation carriers developed polyps, mostly adenomas; polyps were less (12%, p?<?.05) in Mut?-?subjects, and hyperplastic lesions were the prevalent histology. More polyps were detected in MLH1 vs. MSH2 mutation carriers. In Mut+, 21 malignant tumours developed in 14 carriers vs. 4 tumours in 3 patients among Mut- (p?<?.001). Tumours were mostly of the Lynch spectrum; however, three glioblastomas were developed, together with neoplasms of various organs (duodenum, thyroid, skin, lung and cervix). Mean age of tumour occurrence was 43.0 years in Mut?+?vs. 53.0 among Mut-. Cancer developed more often in Mut+, with no consistent difference between MLH1 and MSH2 carriers.

Cross-sectional study of all patients with nodular and superficial spreading melanomas diagnosed between 1994 and 2015 at the Victorian Melanoma Service, Melbourne. Clinical and pathological characteristics of naevus-associated and de novo melanomas were assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of 3678 primary melanomas, 1360 (37.0%) were histologically associated with a naevus and 2318 (63.0%) were de novo melanomas; 71 of 621 nodular (11.4%) and 1289 of 3057 superficial spreading melanomas (42.2%) were histologically associated with a naevus. In multivariable analyses, the odds of being associated with a naevus were higher for melanomas located on the trunk (v head and neck: adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% CI, 1.73-2.96; P < 0.001), while the odds were lower for thicker tumours (adjusted OR, 0.75 per millimetre increase in Breslow thickness; 95% CI, 0.69-0.81; P < 0.001), amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanomas (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.97; P = 0.035), and older age (patients 70 years or older v patients under 30 at diagnosis: adjusted OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.20-0.40; P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the odds of an associated naevus was three times as high for superficial spreading melanomas as for nodular melanomas (adjusted OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 2.24-4.17; P < 0.001). Melanomas are most likely to arise in the absence of a pre-existing naevus, particularly nodular melanomas.

This article describes imaging features of a skin contamination artifact on CEDM that mimics in-situ carcinoma in a case series. Five patients were identified whose CEDM images demonstrated apparent calcifications and non-mass enhancement suspicious for in-situ carcinoma, with no subsequent evidence of disease. Retrospective image analysis was performed on the unprocessed image data, processed images, and imaging parameters. Dual-energy mammographic technique was performed on two breast phantoms with varying degrees of topical contrast contamination. Temporal analysis confirmed the suspicious finding was neither an abnormality of the compression paddle nor the receptor. Comparison of LE and HE images demonstrated the suspicious finding attenuated near the K-edge of iodine, suggesting contrast contamination. Iodinated contrast applied to the surface of breast phantoms replicated the artifact, with a pattern of apparent enhancement similar to the appearance of in-situ carcinoma.

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the microenvironment are essential for tumour growth in a variety of neoplasms but their role in BCC is poorly understood. Material included facial BCC and control skin from the peritumoural area and from the buttocks. With next-generation sequencing (NGS) we compared mRNA expression between BCC and peritumoural skin. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining were performed to validate the NGS results and to investigate CAF-related cyto-and chemokines. NGS revealed upregulation of 65 genes in BCC coding for extracellular matrix components pointing at CAF-related matrix remodeling. qRT-PCR showed increased mRNA expression of CAF markers FAP-??, PDGFR-?? and prolyl-4-hydroxylase in BCC. Peritumoural skin (but not buttock skin) also exhibited high expression of PDGFR-?? and prolyl-4-hydroxylase but not FAP-??. We found a similar pattern for the CAF-associated chemokines CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, CCL25, CXCL12 and IL6 with high expression in BCC and peritumoural skin but absence in buttock skin. Immunofluorescence revealed correlation between FAP-?? and PDGFR-?? and CXCL12 and CCL17. Matrix remodeling is the most prominent molecular feature of BCC.

Success rates vary and since the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) lacks the presence of a kinase necessary to activate acyclovir, there is no proof of its activity against equine sarcoids. Twenty-four equine sarcoids were topically treated with acyclovir cream and 25 with a placebo. Both creams were applied twice daily during 6 months. Before the start of the treatment and further on a monthly basis, photographs and swabs were obtained. On the photographs, sarcoid diameter and surface area were measured and verrucosity of the tumours was quantified using a visual analog scale (VAS). The swabs were analysed by PCR for the presence of BPV DNA and positivity rates were calculated as the number of positive swabs divided by the total number of swabs for each treatment group at each time point. Success rates were not significantly different between both treatment groups. There was also no significant effect of treatment on sarcoid diameter, surface area or VAS score. For the swabs, a significantly higher BPV positivity rate was found for acyclovir treated tumours compared to placebo treated sarcoids only after 1 month of treatment and not at other time points.

To analyze factors associated with delays between diagnosis and surgery for melanoma in patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. Retrospective cohort study of patients who received a diagnosis of melanoma between 2004 and 2011 in North Carolina using data from the North Carolina Cancer Registry linked to administrative claims from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Inclusion criteria were incident patients with a diagnosis of melanoma stage 0 to III and with continuous insurance enrollment from at least 1 month prior to the month of diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis of melanoma. Surgical delay, defined as definitive surgical excision occurring more than 6 weeks after melanoma diagnosis. Generalized linear models with log link, Poisson distributions, and robust standard errors were used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) to model risk of delay in definitive surgery. A total of 7629 patients were included (4210 [55%] female; mean [SD] age, 64 [15] years), 48% (n?=?3631) Medicare, 48% (n?=?3667) privately insured, and 4% (n?=?331) Medicaid patients.

28950146,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is frequently activated in HER2-positive breast cancer and may play a major role in resistance to trastuzumab. Buparlisib is a pan-class-I PI3K inhibitor with potent and selective activity against wild-type and mutant PI3K p110 isoforms. PIKHER2 phase IB study aimed primarily to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and propose a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for buparlisib in combination with lapatinib in HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced breast cancer. Oral buparlisib (40, 60 or 80?mg) and lapatinib (750, 1000 or 1250?mg) were administered daily. A modified continuous reassessment method using an adaptive Bayesian model guided the dose escalation of both agents. Secondary end-points included antitumour activity and pharmacokinetic?(PK) assessments. A total of 24 patients were treated across five dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities included transaminases elevation, vomiting, stomatitis, hyperglycemia and diarrhoea. MTD was declared at buparlisib 80?mg/d?+?lapatinib 1250?mg/d, but toxicities and early treatment discontinuation rate beyond cycle 1 led to select buparlisib 80?mg?+?lapatinib 1000?mg/d as the RP2D. Main drug-related adverse events included diarrhoea, nausea, skin rash, asthenia, depression, anxiety and transaminases increase. There was no significant evidence for drug-drug PK interaction. Disease control rate was 79% [95% confidence interval [CI] 57-92%], one patient obtained a complete remission, and six additional patients experienced stable disease for????24 weeks (clinical benefit rate of 29% [95% CI 12-51%]). Combining buparlisib and lapatinib in HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant advanced breast cancer was feasible.

A number of skin cancer-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) exist, however none adequately consider the difference in type of reconstruction from a patient's point of view. It is the aim of this study to 'anglicise' (to UK English) a recently developed US PROM for facial skin cancer (the FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module) and to validate this UK version of the PROM. The validation will also involve an assessment of the items for relevance to facial reconstruction patients. This will either validate this new measure for the use in clinical care and research of various facial reconstructive options, or provide evidence that a more specific PROM is required. This is a prospective validation study of the FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module in a UK facial skin cancer population with a specific focus on the difference between types of reconstruction. The face and content validity of the FACE-Q questionnaire will initially be assessed by a review process involving patients, skin cancer specialists and methodologists. An assessment of whether questions are relevant and any missing questions will be made. Initial validation will then be carried out by recruiting a cohort of 100 study participants with skin cancer of the face pre-operatively. All eligible patients will be invited to complete the questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively. Psychometric analysis will be performed to test validity, reliability and responsiveness to change. Subgroup analysis will be performed on patients undergoing different forms of reconstruction postexcision of their skin cancer. This study has been approved by the West Midlands, Edgbaston Research Ethics Committee (Ref 16/WM/0445). All personal data collected will be anonymised and patient-specific data will only be reported in terms of group demographics. Identifiable data collected will include the patient name and date of birth. Other collected personal data will include their diagnosis, treatment performed, method of reconstruction and complications. A unique identifier will be applied to each patient so that pretreatment and post-treatment questionnaire results can be compared. All data acquisition and storage will be in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Following completion of the study, all records will be stored in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University (AMBU) Health Board archive facility. Only qualified personnel working on the project will have access to the data.The outputs from this work will be published as widely as possible in peer-review journals and it is our aim to make this open access.",skin_neoplasms

The objective of this review was to identify patterns and incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAE) based on tumour type and ICI class. Medline, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases were searched to identify prospective monotherapy trials of ICIs from 2003 to November 2015. Paired reviewers selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Odds ratio (OR), ??2 tests and multivariable regression models were used to analyse for effect size and associations. We identified 48 trials (6938 patients), including 26 CTLA-4, 17 PD-1, 2 PD-L1 trials, and 3 studies tested both CTLA-4 and PD-1. Grade 3/4 irAE were more common with CTLA-4 mAbs compared with PD-1 (31% versus 10%).

Fluorescence diagnosis (FD) may have utility as a noninvasive method for delineating tumor boundaries. The relationship between FD-delineated borders and results of multiple scouting biopsies (MSBs) in EMPD was investigated, evaluating the potential clinical role of FD. A cohort of 21 patients was studied, looking for consistencies between FD and MSB results. Initial surgical margins were determined by FD or FD plus MSB. All margins were subjected to frozen section analysis. Paget cells were identified in 88 of 117 (71.8%) biopsies obtained from FD borders. When used preoperatively with MSB in 9 patients, 96.4% of margins proved negative at initial resection stage. Using a 6-mm margin beyond FD borders in another 9 patients, 86.7% of margins were negative at initial stage. The maximum distance of excision beyond FD border was 12 mm. Fluorescence diagnosis borders (identified visually) correlated well with MSB histopathology.

28944496,"OCT1002 is a unidirectional hypoxia-activated prodrug (uHAP) OCT1002 that can target hypoxic tumor cells. Hypoxia is a common feature in prostate tumors and is known to drive disease progression and metastasis. It is, therefore, a rational therapeutic strategy to directly target hypoxic tumor cells in an attempt to improve treatment for this disease. Here we tested OCT1002 alone and in combination with standard-of-care agents in hypoxic models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The effect of OCT1002 on tumor growth and vasculature was measured using murine PC3 xenograft and dorsal skin fold (DSF) window chamber models. The effects of abiraterone, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel, both singly and in combination with OCT1002, were also compared. The hypoxia-targeting ability of OCT1002 effectively controls PC3 tumor growth. The effect was evident for at least 42 days after exposure to a single dose (30?mg/kg) and was comparable to, or better than, drugs currently used in the clinic. In DSF experiments OCT1002 caused vascular collapse in the PC3 tumors and inhibited the revascularization seen in controls. In this model OCT1002 also enhanced the anti-tumor effects of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and docetaxel; an effect which was accompanied by a more prolonged reduction in tumor vasculature density. These studies provide the first evidence that OCT1002 can be an effective agent in treating hypoxic, castrate-resistant prostate tumors, either singly or in combination with established chemotherapeutics for prostate cancer.",skin_neoplasms

The vast majority of the lesions do not require dermatological treatment due to their unique clinical course and the high rate of spontaneous regression. Approximately 10-15% of the tumours result in severe complications and sequale, requiring special management and close follow-up. The aim of the present study was to assess the data of the patients treated with infantile haemangiomas, and to summarize the results of the therapy during 4.5 years of study period, in the Paediatric Dermatology Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Dermatology and Allergology, at the University of Szeged. Demographic data of the infants (gender, gestational age and weight, perinatal history of the infant and medical history of mothers), exact date of the visits at Paediatric Dermatology Outpatient Clinic and tumour characteristics (number, subtype, anatomical localisation and complications) were analysed in details. Treatment modalities and therapy intervals, outcomes and the adverse events of the therapies were also discussed in the survey. During the study period, 96 infants with 163 infantile haemangiomas were observed. 54 patients required regular observations, while 42 infants required local or systemic beta-blocker therapy. All of the tumours treated with local or systemic therapy showed marked clinical regression; adverse effects were observed in only 6 cases. The gestational age and gestational weight of infants requiring beta-blocker therapy was significantly lower as compared to children needed only observation. Systemic propranolol is currently the first-line treatment modality for complicated infantile haemangiomas. Our results confirm the significant therapeutic efficacy of propranolol. Early introduction of the treatment is relevant; unfortunately a great proportion of patients are referred late to Paediatric Dermatology Centres.

For experts, the frequencies of correct specific diagnoses of a malignant lesion improved from 40.2% without to 51.3% with dermatoscopy. For all malignant neoplasms combined, the frequencies of appropriate management strategies increased from 78.1% without to 82.5% with dermatoscopy. The study deviated from a real-life clinical setting and was potentially affected by verification and selection bias.

28934992,"Metastases to the thyroid are rare. The most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. Overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. There are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. Isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. Here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature. A 62-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman was diagnosed as having bilateral breast carcinoma in 2004, for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The pathology revealed multifocal disease on the right, T2N0(0/20)M0 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, and on the left side, T3N1(2/18)M0 grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy. The disease was under control on hormonal therapy until 2016, when she developed cervical lymphadenopathy. The fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid was reported as papillary thyroid cancer; and the fine-needle biopsy of the left lateral nodal disease was more suggestive of breast malignancy. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and a clearance of the central compartment lymph nodes and a biopsy of the lateral nodal disease. The histopathological analysis was consistent with metastatic breast cancer in the thyroid and lymph nodes with no evidence of a primary thyroid malignancy. A past history of a malignancy elsewhere should raise the index of suspicion of metastatic disease in patients presenting with thyroid lumps with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Detection of metastases to the thyroid generally indicates poor prognosis, obviating the need of surgery in an already compromised patient. An empirical thyroidectomy should be considered in select patients for local disease control.",skin_neoplasms

We aimed to investigate whether rice intake contributes to urinary arsenic concentration and risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin in a U.S. population. Rice consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire administered as part of a population-based case-control study of 487 SCC cases and 462 age- and gender-matched controls. Arsenic concentration in household tap water and urine samples were measured using inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-resolution ICP-MS, respectively. Odds ratios (OR) for SCC associated with the frequency of rice consumption were estimated using logistic regression, with adjustment for age, gender, and caloric intake. Those who reported any rice consumption had higher urinary arsenic concentrations than those who did not consume rice, and the association was most pronounced among those with <1??g/L arsenic in their household water (19.2% increase in total urinary arsenic, 95% CI: 5.0, 35.3%). Any rice consumption was associated with a 1.5-fold (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) higher odds of SCC compared with those who reported no rice consumption, and the relation appeared to be largely among those with <1??g/L water arsenic. Rice consumption may be related to the occurrence of SCC in the United States, especially among those with relatively low drinking water arsenic exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1065.",skin_neoplasms

This prospective study, which was conducted between September 2015 and May 2016 in the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Hassan II, Fez, Morocco, included 100 cases of dermatofibroma confirmed on clinical and histological grounds. Each lesion was scored for classic, previously reported, or new dermoscopic features. All our Moroccan patients had a dark skin phototype (Fitzpatrick scale types IV and V). A total of 14 morphological dermoscopic structures were distinguished, and 17 dermoscopic patterns were observed, with the most common pattern being the central white patch and peripheral pigment network (21%). New patterns observed in our study were a white ring around an ulceration (6%), a pigment network with a pigmented ring around follicular openings (2%), and a discreet peripheral network and starlike white patch (3%).

We report on 243 patients treated at the University of Pittsburgh in a non-intensive care unit (ICU) oncology specialty setting. Clinical and radiological data were collected on 243 patients treated between 1992 and 2015. Each HD IL-2?cycle was given over 5?days, cycles were repeated after 9?days and courses (2?cycles) were repeated every 6-9?weeks in patients with stable or responding disease, for up to 3 courses total. Influence of baseline characteristics on outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Two hundred forty-three patients received 692?cycles (5270 doses) between 1992 and 2015. Two hundred thirty-seven patients were evaluable for response: OR rate 18.1% with CR rate 8.0%. Median overall survival (OS) 9.6?months in the entire cohort but 64.9?months in responders. Median number of cycles delivered was 2,and median number of doses per cycle was 8. Toxicity was consistent with prior reports. HD IL-2 required ICU transfers in 11 patients and 1 death was attributed to HD IL-2.

In this study we explore the utility of aFP for treating oncological indications, including induction of local tumor regression and inducing anti-tumor immunity, which is in marked contrast to current indications of aFP. We used a fractional CO2 laser to treat a tumor established by BALB/c colon carcinoma cell line (CT26.CL25), which expressed a tumor antigen, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). aFP treated tumors grew significantly slower as compared to untreated controls. Complete remission after a single aFP treatment was observed in 47% of the mice. All survival mice from the tumor inoculation rejected re-inoculation of the CT26.CL25 colon carcinoma cells and moreover 80% of the survival mice rejected CT26 wild type colon carcinoma cells, which are parental cells of CT26.CL25 cells. Histologic section of the FP-treated tumors showed infiltrating neutrophil in the tumor early after aFP treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed aFP treatment abrogated the increase in regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg), which suppresses anti-tumor immunity and elicited the expansion of epitope-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes, which were required to mediate the tumor-suppressing effect of aFP.

We randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to receive nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight plus ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks; nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks plus placebo; or ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses plus placebo, until progression, the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. Randomization was stratified according to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, BRAF mutation status, and metastasis stage. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group versus the ipilimumab group. At a minimum follow-up of 36 months, the median overall survival had not been reached in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and was 37.6 months in the nivolumab group, as compared with 19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.55 [P<0.001]; hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.65 [P<0.001]). The overall survival rate at 3 years was 58% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 52% in the nivolumab group, as compared with 34% in the ipilimumab group. The safety profile was unchanged from the initial report. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 59% of the patients in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, in 21% of those in the nivolumab group, and in 28% of those in the ipilimumab group. Among patients with advanced melanoma, significantly longer overall survival occurred with combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone than with ipilimumab alone.

28887295,"Around 90% of melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and are therefore eminently preventable. Tanning behavior is mostly initiated in early adolescence, often with the belief that it increases attractiveness; the problems related to malignant melanoma and other skin cancers are too far in the future to fathom. Given the substantial amount of time children and adolescents spend in schools, as well as with their mobile phones, addressing melanoma prevention via both of these ways is crucial. However, no school-based intervention using mobile apps has been evaluated to date. We recently released a photoaging mobile app, in which a selfie is altered to predict future appearance dependent on UV protection behavior and skin type. In this pilot study, we aimed to use mobile phone technology to improve school-based melanoma prevention and measure its preliminary success in different subgroups of students with regard to their UV protection behavior, Fitzpatrick skin type and age. We implemented a free photoaging mobile phone app (Sunface) in 2 German secondary schools via a method called mirroring. We ""mirrored"" the students' altered 3-dimensional (3D) selfies reacting to touch on mobile phones or tablets via a projector in front of their whole grade. Using an anonymous questionnaire capturing sociodemographic data as well as risk factors for melanoma we then measured their perceptions of the intervention on a 5-point Likert scale among 205 students of both sexes aged 13-19 years (median 15 years). We measured more than 60% agreement in both items that measured motivation to reduce UV exposure and only 12.5% disagreement: 126 (63.0%) agreed or strongly agreed that their 3D selfie motivated them to avoid using a tanning bed, and 124 (61.7%) to increase use of sun protection. However, only 25 (12.5%) disagreed with both items. The perceived effect on motivation was increased in participants with Fitzpatrick skin types 1-2 in both tanning bed avoidance (n=74, 71.8% agreement in skin types 1-2 vs n=50, 53.8% agreement in skin types 3-6) and increased use of sun protection (n=70, 68.0% agreement in skin types 1-2 vs n=52, 55.3% agreement in skin types 3-6), and also positively correlated with higher age. We present a novel way of integrating photoaging in school-based melanoma prevention that affects the students' peer group, considers the predictors of UV exposure in accordance with the theory of planned behavior, and is particularly effective in changing behavioral predictors in fair-skinned adolescents (Fitzpatrick skin types 1-2). Further research is required to evaluate the intervention's prospective effects on adolescents of various cultural backgrounds.",skin_neoplasms

We have retrospectively analyzed the data of patients affected by eyelids carcinoma with nodal involvement. The clinical records of 10 patients with malignant eyelid carcinoma and regional nodal metastasis treated between September 2011 and March 2015 have been analyzed. The study included 5 women and 5 men (median age 54,5 years; range 37-80 years). The most common tumor was the squamous cell carcinoma (4 cases) followed by sebaceous carcinoma (2 cases): 1 case of epidermoid carcinoma, 1 case of malignant melanoma, 1 case of Merkel carcinoma, and 1 case of basal cell carcinoma. All patients were treated by surgical resection; in 2 cases, orbital exenteration was required. The treatment of regional nodal metastasis consisted of parotidectomy and radical neck dissection followed by radiation therapy. None of the patients developed local recurrence. Three patients died: one, affected by Merkel cell carcinoma, died after 2 months because of metastatic dissemination to the lung; another one, affected by epidermoid carcinoma involving the orbit, died because of liver metastasis; the third one, affected by malignant melanoma, died because of other causes. The follow-up time ranged from 9 to 36 months (median 19.3 months). Patients affected by advanced malignant eyelid carcinoma need to be strictly controlled because metastasis can develop at least 5 years after surgical treatment.

28885214,"Breast Carcinoma is the most common malign tumor disease in women. 20-30% of these tumors have to be treated by removing all of the breast tissue. After that kind of therapeutic procedure, most of the women are severely traumatized and ask for reconstruction. The goldstandard of breast reconstruction is the free perforator flap from the lower abdomen (DIEAP-flap), which can provide body-own tissue and natural shape for the reconstructed breast.Many studies evaluate the shape of the reconstructed breast but neglect the skin sensitivity. Claim of this study was to compare this important part of reconstruction on two different techniques of mastectomy. In this retrospective study we evaluated which technique of mastectomy and breast reconstruction with DIEAP-Flap offers the highest outcome for sensibility of the reconstructed breast. Skin sparing mastectomy was compared with conventional mastectomy and the results of skin sensitivity were measured. Ten patients underwent breast reconstruction with free abdominal perforator flap between 2011 and 2015 after conventional mastectomy (CM) and were compared with ten patients, who had a skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate reconstruction by DIEAP-flap during the same time interval. These two groups were matched by age, height, weight and the time between reconstruction and examination. The sensitivity of the skin was measured by Semmes-Weinstein-Filaments in the strength beginning from 0,07?g till 300?g for deep sensation. The logarithmic profile of these measurements had been transferred into a continuous data system beginning from 1 point, which stands for no sensation, till 7 points for pressure threshold of 0,07?g. Patients who underwent DIEAP-reconstruction after skin sparing mastectomy showed a higher sensation at all regions of the new breast in comparison to reconstruction after conventional mastectomy, beginning from the nipple to the areola and the breast skin. The results in the CM-group were 1.0 points at the mamilla, 1.33?pts. at the areola and 1.78?pts. at the breast skin. In the SSM-group, the findings were 3?pts. at the mamilla, 3.25?pts. at the areola and 5.25?pts. at the breast skin. The skin sparing mastectomy combined with immediate reconstruction by DIEAP-flap provides an excellent therapeutic option for patients, who are suitable for this technique, which takes into account not only the form but also the sensitivity of the breast.",skin_neoplasms

This multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in low and intermediate grade advanced pNETs. Tumors were graded according to the World Health Organization 2010 classification system. Patients with low or intermediate grade pNETs who received everolimus as first- or second-line chemotherapy between 2002 and 2014 were included. A total of 40 patients with metastatic or recurrent pNETs were included in this study. The median age was 54.5?years (range 19-83?years). Twelve patients (30%) experienced recurrence. There were 11 patients (27.5%) with low grade pNETs and 29 (72.5%) with intermediate. Everolimus was administered as first-line therapy in 30 patients (75%) and as second-line therapy in 10 patients (25%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with low and intermediate grade pNETs was significantly different (median not reached vs. 11?months, P?=?0.015). On multivariate analysis, tumor grade (intermediate grade; HR 6.52, 95% CI 1.31-32.27, P?=?0.022) was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS in pNETs.

But preventive interventions like skin cancer screening are still missing the evidence for effectiveness and therefore are criticised. Fundamental for an appropriate course of action is to approach the defined parameters as measures for effectiveness critically. A prerequisite should be the critical application of used parameter that are defined as measures for effectiveness. This research seeks to establish, through the available literature, the effects and conditions that prove the effectiveness of prevention strategies in skin cancer. A mixed-method approach is employed to combine quantitative to qualitative methods and answer what effects can display effectiveness considering time horizon, perspective and organisational level and what are essential and sufficient conditions to prove effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in skin cancer prevention strategies. A systematic review will be performed to spot studies from any design and assess the data quantitatively and qualitatively. Included studies from each key question will be summarised by characteristics like population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, study design, endpoints, effect estimator and so on. Beside statistical relevancies for a systematic review the qualitative method of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) will be performed. The estimated outcomes from this review and QCA are the accomplishment and absence of effects that are appropriate for application in effectiveness assessments and further cost-effectiveness assessment.

Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) is associated with the expression of interferon, which is used as an effective adjuvant therapy for melanoma, and is regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, little is known about the methylation status of the IRF6 gene in melanoma. The purpose was to determine the methylation status of the CGI located in the 5' region of IRF6 (5' IRF6 CGI) in melanoma. Quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (RT-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing were performed to examine IRF6 gene methylation status. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to examine IRF6 expression. The methylation level of the 5' IRF6 CGI was completely inversely correlated with cell sensitivity to interferon-?? in eight examined melanoma cell lines. These methylation levels were high in the melanoma cell lines with suppression of IRF6 expression and were low in the cell lines with IRF6 expression. The methylation levels of the 5' IRF6 CGI ranged widely from 0.0% to 65.4% in 21 clinical melanoma samples but showed a narrow range of low levels between 0.0% to 7.2% in 24 clinical melanocytic nevus samples.

We sought to determine the diagnostic utility of these nuclear stains by comparing their staining pattern to adipophilin, a consistently positive cytoplasmic stain. Cases with the diagnosis of sebaceous hyperplasia, sebaceous adenoma, sebaceous epithelioma/sebaceoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and nonsebaceous neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) were examined. Intensity and extent of staining of the basal cells and mature sebocytes were evaluated for each stain. Factor XIIIa (AC-1A1) was 87.3% sensitive and 95.1% specific for all sebaceous neoplasms sand showed high inter-observer reliability. Adipophilin was 83.2% sensitive and 87.8% specific. GATA3 was the least sensitive (80.9%) and specific (75.6%) marker. When factor XIIIa was compared against composite staining of all three markers its staining was still uniquely significant (P?=?.0210). Factor XIIIa (AC-1A1) is a sensitive and specific nuclear marker for sebaceous differentiation. Its diagnostic utility exceeds that of adipophilin. Factor XIIIa should be included in the expanding group of immunohistochemical and special stains which can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of sebaceous neoplasms.",skin_neoplasms

A retrospective study was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent screening FFDM in 2010-2012 and DBT in 2012-2013 at an academic institution. Examinations were performed by five experienced technologists who underwent updated standardized positioning training. Positioning criteria were assessed by consensus reads among three breast radiologists and compared with FS mammography data from a 1993 study by Bassett and colleagues. One hundred seventy patients (n = 340 examinations) were analyzed, showing significant differences between FFDM and DBT examinations (p < 0.05) for medial or inferior skin folds (FFDM vs DBT: craniocaudal [CC] view, 16% [n = 56] vs 23% [n = 77]; mediolateral oblique [MLO] view, 35% [n = 118] vs 45% [n = 154]), inclusion of lateral glandular tissue on CC view (FFDM vs DBT, 73% [n = 247] vs 81% [n = 274]), and concave pectoralis muscle shape (FFDM vs DBT, 36% [n = 121] vs 28% [n = 95]). In comparison with Bassett et al. data, all positioning criteria for both FFDM and DBT examinations were significantly different (p < 0.05). The largest differences were found in visualization of the pectoralis muscle on CC views and the inframammary fold on MLO views, inclusion of posterior or lateral glandular tissue, and inclusion of skin folds, with DBT and FFDM more frequently exhibiting all criteria than originally reported Bassett et al.  DBT and FFDM mammograms more frequently include posterior or lateral tissue, the inframammary fold on MLO views, the pectoralis muscle on CC views, and skin folds than FS mammograms.

Clinical parameters, including patient background, AEs, and changes in biochemical parameters until day 28, were evaluated to identify efficacy predictors. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.1 months, and median overall survival was 6.6 months. Major AEs in all cycles were hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, and increased aspartate transaminase. We extracted 121 patients for prognostic analysis.

Understanding the decisional factors driving sun protection choices could aid in intervention development to promote sun protection maintenance. In 59 first-degree relatives of melanoma patients, an interactive voice response system (IVRS) on participants' cell phones was used to assess twice daily (morning, afternoon) real-time sun protection usage (sunscreen, shade, hats, protective clothing) and decision factors (weather, type of activity, convenience, social support) over a 14-day summer interval where morning and afternoon outdoor exposures were anticipated. Generalized estimating equations and hierarchical linear models were used to examine the effect of demographics and decisional factors on sun protection choices over time. Sun protection use was inconsistent (e.g., 61% used sunscreen inconsistently). Most strategies were used independently, with the exception of moderate overlap of sunscreen and hat usage. Decision factors were highly relevant for sun protection. For instance, sunscreen use was related to the perception of having adequate time to apply it, whereas shade and hat usage were each related to convenience. Few findings emerged by gender, age, time of day, or year. Significant within-subject variation remained, however.

28844157,"Normal tissue morbidity sets the dose limit for radiotherapy (RT) in cancer treatment and has importance for quality of life for cancer survivors. A previous study of prostate cancer patients treated with RT generated clinical data for radiation-induced morbidity measured by anorectal physiological methods and validated questionnaires. Other studies have identified genetic predictors associated with late radiation-induced morbidity outcome. We have expanded biobank material aiming to validate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a gene expression classifier with endpoints on patient-reported outcomes and biomechanical properties of the anorectum from our cohort matching originally published endpoints. The present cohort of prostate cancer patients was treated with RT curative intent in 1999-2007. Nine SNPs associated with late radiation-induced morbidity were tested in 96 patients (rs2788612, rs1800629, rs264663, rs2682585, rs2268363, rs1801516, rs13035033, rs7120482 and rs17779457). A validated gene expression profile predictive of resistance to radiation-induced skin fibrosis was tested in 42 patients. An RT-induced anorectal dysfunction score (RT-ARD) served as a fibrosis-surrogate and a measure of overall radiation-induced morbidity. The lowest p-value found in the genotype analyses was for SNP rs2682585 minor allele (A) in the FSHR gene and the RT-ARD score with odds ratios (OR)?=?1.76; 95% CI (0.98-3.17) p?=?.06, which was out of concordance with original data showing a protective effect of the minor allele. The gene expression profile in patients classified as fibrosis-resistant was associated with high RT-ARD scores OR 4.18; 95% CI (1.1-16.6), p?=?.04 conflicting with the hypothesis that fibrosis-resistant patients would experience lower RT-ARD scores. We aimed to validate nine SNPs and a gene expression classifier in a cohort of prostate cancer patients with unique scoring of radiation-induced morbidity. One significant association was found, pointing to the opposite direction of originally published data. We conclude that the material was not able to validate previously published genetic predictors of radiation-induced morbidity.",skin_neoplasms

This study examines the clinical course and outcomes of a large series of patients who underwent orbital exenteration for malignant periocular neoplasms. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent orbital exenteration from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2015 at four tertiary referral centres in the USA, Australia and Canada. Demographics, indication for surgery, pathology, surgical technique, reconstruction type and outcomes were reviewed. Orbital exenteration was performed on 102 patients. The mean age at surgery was 67.5 years. The most common malignant tumours encountered were squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Seventy-six patients (75%) underwent reconstruction with a local myocutaneous flap, twelve with partial-thickness skin grafts (PTSG), or split skin graft, two had a free flap, and one had a dermis fat graft. Sixteen patients had combined procedures of two of the above. Complete removal of the tumour was achieved with clear margins in 81 cases. Of all patients, 72% were alive at 48 months or more. The majority of orbital exenterations performed in this series were secondary to periocular malignancies with unsuccessful/insufficient previous treatments. Regional myocutaneous flaps, PTSG, full-thickness skin grafts and dermis fat grafts were all highly effective and durable reconstructive options, and were able to withstand radiation therapy without complications.",skin_neoplasms

The senior author (D.T.W.C.) has developed a technique of adipose tissue-preserved full-thickness skin grafts for larger areas with success similar to that achieved with conventional full-thickness skin grafts. All cases of the senior author involving a full-thickness skin graft were identified and reviewed to identify cases in which adipose tissue-preserved full-thickness skin grafts were used. Indication for skin grafting, anatomical location of recipient and donor sites, size of graft, total number of grafts received by each patient, and percentage take were extracted from patient charts. Graft take was measured between days 5 and 14. A total of 72 adipose tissue-preserved skin grafts on 47 patients were identified from 1994 to 2009, with a median follow-up of 8 years. The size of defect ranged from 0.7 to 210 cm, with a median area of 6 cm (interquartile range, 2.5 to 15 cm). Only six of 72 grafts were found to have less than 100 percent take. The lowest take percentage was 85 percent in a graft with an area of 2.6 cm. There were no graft failures. This study confirms the proof-of-concept that both larger and distant donor- site adipose tissue-preserved skin grafts are a viable alternative to conventional defatted full-thickness skin grafting.

28837757,"Malignant wounds are a devastating complication of cancer. They usually develop in the last six months of life, in the breast, chest wall or head and neck regions. They are very difficult to treat successfully, and the commonly associated symptoms of pain, exudate, malodour, and the risk of haemorrhage are extremely distressing for those with advanced cancer. Treatment and care of malignant wounds is primarily palliative, and focuses on alleviating pain, controlling infection and odour from the wound, managing exudate and protecting the surrounding skin from further deterioration. In malignant wounds, with tissue degradation and death, there is proliferation of both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The aim of antibiotic therapy is to successfully eliminate these bacteria, reduce associated symptoms, such as odour, and promote wound healing. To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for treating malignant wounds. We searched the following electronic databases on 8 March 2017: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched the clinical trial registries of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 March 2017; and OpenSIGLE (to identify grey literature) and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global (to retrieve dissertation theses related to our topic of interest) on 13 March 2017. Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of any systemic antibiotics on malignant wounds were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted study data. A third reviewer checked extracted data for accuracy prior to analysis. We identified only one study for inclusion in this review. This study was a prospective, double-blind cross-over trial that compared the effect of systemic metronidazole with a placebo on odour in malignant wounds. Nine participants with a fungating wound and for whom the smell was troublesome were recruited and six of these completed both the intervention and control (placebo) stages of the trial. Each stage lasted fourteen days, with a fourteen day gap (washout period) between administration of the metronidazole and the placebo.The study, in comparing metronidazole and placebo, reported on two of this review's pre-specified primary outcomes (malodour and adverse effects of the treatment) and on none of the review's pre-specified secondary outcomes.MalodourThe mean malodour (smell) scores for the metronidazole group was 1.17 (standard deviation (SD) 1.60) and the mean for the placebo group was 3.33 (SD 0.82). It is unclear if systemic antibiotics were associated with a difference in malodour (1 study with 6 participants; MD -2.16, 95% CI -3.6 to -0.72) as the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was very low for this outcome. The study was downgraded due to high risk of attrition bias (33% loss to follow-up) and very serious imprecision due to the small sample size.Adverse effectsNo adverse effects of the treatment were reported in either the intervention or control group by the trial authors. It is uncertain whether systemic metronidazole leads to a reduction in malodour in patients with malignant wounds. This is because we were only able to include a single study at high risk of bias with a very small sample size, which focused only on patients with breast cancer. More research is needed to substantiate these findings and to investigate the effects of systemic metronidazole and other antibiotics on quality of life, pain relief, exudate and tumour containment in patients with malignant wounds.",skin_neoplasms
28835228,"Previous studies have investigated the protective effect of vitamin D serum levels, at diagnosis and during the follow-up period after treatment, on melanoma outcome. In the present study we assess whether vitamin D supplementation, in the follow-up period after diagnosis and surgical resection of the primary tumor, has a protective effect on relapse of cutaneous malignant melanoma and whether this protective effect correlates with vitamin D levels in serum and Vitamin D Receptor immunoreactivity in the primary tumor. This study is a multicenter randomized double blind placebo- controlled phase III trial. Patients between the age of 18 and 80?years diagnosed and treated surgically for a melanoma stage IB-III are eligible for randomization in a 1:1 ratio to active treatment or placebo. The study drug is taken each month and consists of either 100,000 International Unit cholecalciferol or arachidis oleum raffinatum used as a placebo. The primary endpoint is relapse free survival. The secondary endpoints are 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 serum levels at diagnosis and at 6?month intervals, melanoma subtype, melanoma site and stage of melanoma at diagnosis according to the 2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging and classification. At randomization a bloodsample is taken for DNA analysis. The study is approved by the local Ethics Committees. If we can confirm our hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation after removal of the tumor has a protective effect on relapse of cutaneous malignant melanoma we may reduce the burden of CMM at several levels. Patients, diagnosed with melanoma may have a better clinical outcome and improved quality of life. There will be a decrease in health care costs related to treatment of metastatic disease and there will be a decrease in loss of professional years, which will markedly reduce the economic burden of the disease.

Before the introduction, eligible physicians had to qualify to perform the screening test and counsel their patients on skin cancer screening. To educate physicians, a curriculum and training materials were developed. Since 2015 a revised curriculum and training materials have been used. The purpose of this paper is to provide information about the curriculum and to evaluate the revised training program. A total of 573 completed pre- and posttests were analyzed with regard to changes in the identification of skin cancer, diagnostic accuracy, knowledge, and physicians' self-assessed-confidence. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Cohen's d, and chi-square test were used. General practitioners (GPs) diagnosed 7.45 of 12 skin lesions correctly before and 9.26 after the training course (P < 0.001). Compared to GPs, dermatologists' accuracy was higher at pre- and posttest (pre: 10.03, post: 10.21, P = 0.160). The mean of correctly answered questions increased significantly in knowledge on screening and early detection (4.46-5.14, P < 0.001) as well as skin cancer and skin cancer screening (5.51-6.39, P < 0.001).

A cross-sectional survey of 150 patients with head and neck cancer was conducted. Sixty patients had nasopharyngeal cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy without surgery, and 90 patients had oral cavity cancer treated with radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy. All participants completed a 10-item Body Image Scale (BIS) questionnaire to assess body image dissatisfaction. Among all patients, the socio-demographic and clinical variables were age, gender, partnership, education, employment, and radical surgery. In surgically-treated patients, the clinical variables were facial skin sacrificed, mouth angle sacrificed, glossectomy, maxillectomy, and mandibulectomy. ANOVAs, t-tests, and multiple regressions were used to evaluate the relationships between these variables and BIS results. In all patients, radical surgery was the strongest independent predictor of BIS scores. Surgically-treated patients had significantly worse BIS scores than the patients without surgery. In surgically-treated patients, facial skin sacrificed, mouth angle sacrificed, maxillectomy, and mandibulectomy were significantly associated with body image. According to multivariable analyses, inferior maxillectomy and segmental mandibulectomy were independent prognosticators of a poor BIS score in surgically-treated patients.

Forty-one patients with primary subungual melanoma of less than or equal to 2-mm thickness who were treated with functional surgery were prospectively enrolled. After oncologic resection, a thin SCIP flap was harvested along the trans-superficial fat layer and transferred to the defect with further thinning by primary defatting. Complications and oncologic outcomes were investigated. Postoperative functional status was assessed, using the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire for finger cases and the Foot Function Index for toe cases, and was compared with that of patients treated with amputation. The SCIP flap was inset with a final thickness ranging from 1.5 to 4 mm after defatting. Total flap failure occurred in one patient. Complete wound healing was achieved within 3 weeks postoperatively in most cases (90.2 percent). The majority of patients achieved satisfactory contour without needing secondary debulking.

A total of 125 patients who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2015 at our institution were included from the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium study database. Adjusted multivariate models were created incorporating RT technical data, age, cancer stage, estrogen receptor, chemotherapy, breast size, body mass index, and income to determine whether RT was associated with outcomes. At 1?year after surgery, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire breast symptoms were significantly greater in 64 patients who received RT (8-point difference on 100-point ordinal scale, P<.0001) versus 61 who did not receive RT in univariate and multivariate models. EORTC arm symptoms (20-point difference on 100-point ordinal scale, P=.0200) differed on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis. All other outcomes-including Numerical Pain Rating Scale, BREAST-Q (Post-operative Reconstruction Module), Patient-Report Outcomes Measurement Information System Profile 29, McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF) score, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-were not statistically different between groups. Surgical complications were uncommon and did not differ by treatment. RT to the neo-breast compared with no RT following immediate autologous free flap reconstruction for breast cancer is well tolerated at 1?year following surgery despite patients undergoing RT also having a higher cancer stage and more intensive surgical and systemic treatment. Neo-breast symptoms are more common in patients receiving RT by the EORTC Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire but not by the BREAST-Q.

As a result, more effective therapeutic modalities are needed for the treatment of oral cancer. Consequently, in the present study, we examined the feasibility of using a dual peptide carrier approach, combining an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting peptide with an endosome-disruptive peptide, to mediate targeted delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer cells and induce silencing of the targeted oncogene, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A). Fluorescence microscopy, real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and in vivo bioimaging of mice containing orthotopic xenograft tumors were used to examine the ability of the dual peptide carrier to mediate specific delivery of bioactive siRNAs into EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer cells/tissues. Co-complexation of the EGFR-targeting peptide, GE11R9, with the endosome-disruptive 599 peptide facilitated the specific uptake of siRNAs into oral cancer cells overexpressing EGFR in vitro with optimal gene silencing observed at a 60:30:1 (GE11R9:599:siRNA) molar ratio. Furthermore, when administered systemically to mice bearing xenograft oral tumors, this dual peptide complex mediated increased targeted delivery of siRNAs into tumor tissues in comparison to the 599 peptide alone and significantly enhanced CIP2A silencing. Herein we provide the first report demonstrating the clinical potential of a dual peptide strategy for siRNA-based therapeutics by synergistically mediating the effective targeting and delivery of bioactive siRNAs into EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer cells.",skin_neoplasms

Our goal was to systematically investigate the association of arsenic metabolism with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes-related outcomes in epidemiologic studies. As a secondary objective, we characterized the variation of arsenic metabolism in different populations worldwide. We searched Medline/PubMed and EMBASE from inception to January 2016 and applied predetermined exclusion criteria. Compositional data analysis was used to describe the distribution of arsenic metabolism biomarkers and evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and metabolism. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, 12 on cancer, nine on cardiovascular disease, and seven on diabetes-related outcomes. The median (interquartile range) for mean iAs%, MMA%, and DMA% was 11.2 (7.8-14.9)%, 13.0 (10.4-13.6)%, and 74.9 (69.8-80.0)%, respectively. Findings across studies suggested that higher arsenic exposure levels were associated with higher iAs% and lower DMA% and not associated with MMA%. For cancer, most studies found a pattern of higher MMA% and lower DMA% associated with higher risk of all-site, urothelial, lung, and skin cancers. For cardiovascular disease, higher MMA% was generally associated with higher risk of carotid atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascular disease but not with hypertension. For diabetes-related outcomes, the pattern of lower MMA% and higher DMA% was associated with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Population level of iAs% and DMA%, but not MMA%, were associated with arsenic exposure levels. Overall, study findings suggest that higher MMA% was associated with an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease, while lower MMA% was associated with an increased risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Additional population-based studies and experimental studies are needed to further evaluate and understand the role of arsenic exposure in arsenic metabolism and the role of arsenic metabolism in disease development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP577.",skin_neoplasms
28793172,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a malignant neuroendocrine skin tumor frequently associated with the Merkel cell polyomavirus. Immune checkpoint therapy showed remarkable results, although not all patients are responsive to this therapy. Anti-tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA)-targeted treatment has shown promising results in several tumor entities. To determine TrkA expression in MCC as a rationale for potential targeted therapy. This case series study investigated the MCC specimens of 55 patients treated at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany, from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2015. Thirty-nine of the 55 samples were suitable for further histopathologic examination. Expression of TrkA was explored by immunohistochemical analysis. Diagnosis of MCC was confirmed by staining positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and synaptophysin. Expression of TrkA on the tumor cells. Specimens of 39 patients (21 women and 18 men; mean [SD] age, 75.0 [7.8] years) underwent immunohistochemical investigation. Thirty-eight of 38 specimens expressed CK20 and synaptophysin on the MCC tumor cells (100% expression). Merkel cell polyomavirus was detected in 32 of 38 specimens (84%). Tropomyosin receptor kinase A was found in all 36 evaluable specimens on the tumor cells; 34 (94%) showed a weak and 2 (6%) showed a strong cytoplasmic expression. In addition, strongly positive perinuclear dots were observed in 30 of 36 specimens (83%). Tropomyosin receptor kinase A was expressed on MCC tumor cells in 100% of evaluable specimens. This result may lead to the exploration of new targeted treatment options in MCC, especially for patients who do not respond to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 treatment.",skin_neoplasms
28791994,"to study the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with seborrheic keratomas (SK) and insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)) and in those without concomitant carbohydrate metabolic disturbances. 80 patients with SK were examined. According to the presence or absence of DM2, the patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 40 patients with concomitant DM2; 2) 40 people without carbohydrate metabolic disturbances. DM2 was diagnosed on the basis of laboratory studies and an endocrinologist's consultation. Histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) examinations using anti-EGFR antibodies were performed; two intact skin sections from the patients with DM2 and two intact skin sections from those without carbohydrate metabolic disturbances were used as a control. The ICH examination using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies revealed that Group 1 showed intense diffuse membrane staining of more than 50% of the cells in 32 (80%) patients, moderate (30-50% cells) and weak (10-30% cells) staining in 6 (15%) and 2 (5%) patients, respectively. Marked EGFR expression was also noted in two intact skin biopsy specimens taken from patients with DM2. In Group 2, the staining intensity was weak in more than 10% but less than 30% of the SK cells in 28 (70%) patients; moderate EGFR expression was observed in 9 (22.5%) and diffuse, pronounced, staining in more than 50% of the SK cells was in 3 (7.5%) patients. The intact skin biopsy specimens taken from 2 patients without carbohydrate metabolic disturbances displayed a weak EGFR expression in the basal cell layer of the epidermis. EGFR overexpression in SK may be a result of metabolic disorders rather than a diagnostic sign of malignant neoplasms of the internal organs. The increased EGFR expression revealed in patients with SK and concomitant DM2 is caused by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, in which the dysregulation of insulin signal transmission into the cell leads to changes in EGF synthesis and signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and growth.",skin_neoplasms

This study aimed to determine if BRAF and NRAS mutant and wild-type tumours differ in their site of first tumour metastasis and anatomical metastatic pathway. Prospective cohort of patients with a histologically confirmed primary cutaneous melanoma at three tertiary referral centres in Melbourne, Australia from 2010 to 2015. Multinomial regression determined clinical, histological and mutational factors associated with the site of first metastasis and metastatic pathway. Of 1048 patients, 306 (29%) developed metastasis over a median 4.7 year follow-up period. 73 (24%), 192 (63%) and 41 (13%) developed distant, regional lymph node and satellite/in-transit metastasis as the first site of metastasis, respectively. BRAF mutation was associated with lymph node metastasis (adjusted RRR 2.46 95% CI 1.07-5.69, P=0.04) and sentinel lymph node positivity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14-2.10, P=0.005). BRAF mutation and NRAS mutation were associated with increased odds of developing liver metastasis (aOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.49-6.42, P=0.003; aOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.32-7.58, P=0.01) and central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (aOR 4.65, 95% CI 2.23-9.69, P<0.001; aOR 4.03, 95% CI 1.72-9.44, P=0.001). NRAS mutation was associated with lung metastasis (aOR 2.44, 95% CI 1.21-4.93, P=0.01). BRAF mutation was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis as first metastasis and sentinel lymph node positivity. BRAF and NRAS mutations were associated with CNS and liver metastasis and NRAS mutation with lung metastasis. If these findings are validated in additional prospective studies, a role for heightened visceral organ surveillance may be warranted in patients with tumours harbouring these somatic mutations.",skin_neoplasms
28786105,"13-Cis retinoic acid (13-CRA) is a synthetic vitamin A derivative. High-dose 13-CRA in patients with squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHNs) reduces the incidence of second primary tumors (SPTs). The authors report long-term results from a phase 3 randomized trial that compared treatment with low-dose 13-CRA versus placebo for patients who had early stage SCCHN, with a focus on the development of SPTs and overall survival (OS). In total, 176 patients who received treatment for stage I/II SCCHN were randomized to receive either low-dose 13-CRA (weight-based dose of 7.5?mg or 10?mg) or placebo for 2 years. A competing-risk approach and the log-rank test were used to compare the time to SPT and OS, respectively, between groups. 13-CRA neither significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SPT (P?=?.61) nor improved the time to SPT (hazard ratio [HR] for 13-CRA/placebo; 0.86; P?=?.61). Despite limited power, there was a trend toward improved OS for the 13-CRA arm (HR, 0.75; P?=?.14), particularly among patients whose index tumor was surgically excised (N?=?26; HR, 0.50; P?=?.057) and among women (N?=?39; HR, 0.44; P?=?.065) and never/former smokers (N?=?129; HR, 0.61; P?=?.055), with a median follow-up of 16 years. The main 13-CRA related toxicities were dry skin and cheilitis. Treatment with low-dose 13-CRA for 2 years did not decrease the incidence of SPT; subset analysis indicates a potential survival advantage among patients who are women and never/former smokers. More targeted interventions based on clinical risk factors and molecular characterization of tumors may yield greater success in future prevention trials.

From January 2007 to March 2014, patients initially treated for stage I NSCLC with CIRT and relapsed in-field were candidates. Overall survival (OS) rate, local control (LC) rate, progressive free survival (PFS) rate, dose to the lungs and skin, and adverse effects were analyzed. Twenty-nine patients were eligible. Median age at re-irradiation was 74years (range 53-90). Median observation period from the first day of re-irradiation was 29months (4-88months). Median prescribed dose was 46.0Gy (RBE) as initial treatment and 66.0Gy (RBE) in 12 fractions as re-irradiation. Two-year OS, LC, and PFS rates after re-irradiation were 69.0% (95% CI: 50.3-83.0), 66.9% (95% CI: 47.5-81.9), and 51.7% (95% CI: 34.1-68.9). Median skin maximum dose was 53.8Gy (RBE) (range 4.4-103.1) and median of mean lung dose was 7.3Gy (RBE) (range 2.6-14.0).

There have been concerns about the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in patients treated with this drug. We sought to determine whether treatment with vismodegib is associated with an increase in the risk of cutaneous SCC. In this retrospective cohort study, patients treated with vismodegib as part of phase I and II clinical studies were compared with participants from the University of California, San Francisco, Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer Cohort who received standard therapy for primary BCC. In total, 1675 patients were included in the analysis, and the development of SCC after vismodegib exposure was assessed. The use of vismodegib was not associated with an increased risk of subsequent development of SCC (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-1.16). Covariates including age, sex, history of previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, and number of visits per year were significantly associated with the development of SCC. A limitation of the study was that a historic control cohort was used as a comparator.

Analyses involved 779,978 males and 1,032,868 females diagnosed with 1 of 13 cancer types between 2000 and 2008, and followed through 2013. Data are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race, and tumor stage. Five-year relative survival conditional on years already survived is higher among married patients with less lethal cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, colon and rectum, breast, urinary bladder, kidney and renal pelvis, melanoma of the skin, thyroid, lymphoma). For more lethal cancers, married patients have similar (liver, lung and bronchus, pancreas, leukemia) or poorer (brain and other nervous system) cancer survival. Separated/divorced or widowed patients have the lowest conditional relative survival rates. For most cancers, 5-year cancer relative survival rates conditional on time already survived through 5?years approach 70 to 90% of that for the general population. The beneficial effect of marriage on survival decreases with years already survived. Superior conditional relative survival rates in females decrease with time already survived and are less pronounced in married patients. Five-year relative survival rates improve with time already survived. The benefits of marriage on conditional relative survival are greater for less lethal cancers. Greater 5-year conditional relative survival rates in females narrow with time already survived and are less pronounced in married patients. Conditional relative survival rates of cancer can lead to more informed decisions and understanding regarding treatment and prognosis.",skin_neoplasms

This study aimed to examine the role of quantitative parameters of tumour lymphangiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C in predicting metastatic risk in patients with cutaneous melanoma. One hundred melanoma specimens were stained with lymphatic-specific antibody D2-40 and with anti-VEGF-C antibody. Quantitative parameters of lymphangiogenesis-lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and lymphatic vessel area (LVA)-were determined by computer-assisted morphometric analysis. Moderate or strong staining was assessed as a positive expression of VEGF-C in tumour cells. Univariate analysis revealed that intratumoural LVD, peritumoural LVD, VEGF-C expression in tumour cells, melanoma thickness, Clark level, ulceration, gender and histologic type were significant predictors of lymph node metastasis (p?=?0.000, p?=?0.000, p?=?0.000, p?=?0.000, p?=?0.005, p?=?0.005, p?=?0.011 and p?=?0.027, respectively).

Digital plain photography images of verified mole and melanoma lesions were downloaded from (i) Edinburgh University Hospital, UK, (Dermofit, 330moles/70 melanomas, under signed agreement), from 5 different centers (Multicenter, 63moles/25 melanomas, publicly available), and from the Groningen University, Netherlands (Groningen, 100moles/70 melanomas, publicly available). Images were processed for outlining the lesion-border and isolating the lesion from the surrounding background. Fourteen features were generated from each lesion evaluating texture (4), structure (5), shape (4) and color (1). Features were subjected to statistical analysis for determining differences in pictorial properties between moles and melanomas. The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier, the exhaustive search features selection, the leave-one-out (LOO), and the external cross-validation (ECV) methods were used to design the PR-system for discriminating between moles and melanomas. Statistical analysis revealed that melanomas as compared to moles were of lower intensity, of less homogenous surface, had more dark pixels with intensities spanning larger spectra of gray-values, contained more objects of different sizes and gray-levels, had more asymmetrical shapes and irregular outlines, had abrupt intensity transitions from lesion to background tissue, and had more distinct colors.

Using the National Cancer Database, a large national database consisting of a heterogeneous population and treatment settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2093 patients 18 years or older with stage I to III MCC of the extremities and/or trunk treated with definitive surgery and adjuvant RT between 1998 and 2011. Exclusion criteria included receiving treatment with palliative intent, preoperative RT, non-external-beam RT, and radiation dose of 30 Gy or lower or 70 Gy or higher. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare overall survival (OS) between RT dose groups, accounting for age, sex, race, stage, surgery type, margin status, comorbidities, and use of chemotherapy.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy has proven useful in the assessment of early regional metastasis in sebaceous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. The pathologic finding of perineural invasion is a high-risk feature in all periocular cancers, and adjuvant therapy should be considered. Targeted therapy shows great potential in situations that are not amenable to complete excision without sacrificing the globe. Identification of high- and low-risk features in eyelid cancers allows a stratified approach to treatment.

28734546,"To evaluate previously published whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) using ILD (isocentring lateral decubitus) technique in terms of toxicity and efficacy. From 2006 to 2010, 832 female patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) treated by conservative surgery underwent 3D-conformal WBRT-ILD at Institut Curie. The acute toxicity of treatment was evaluated weekly and the late toxicity (6months and later after the treatment) was evaluated every 6months till the 5th year after the end of the radiotherapy using NCI CTC v3.0 scale. Dosimetric study was performed to analyse the mean cardiac dose and the mean homolateral and contralateral lung doses. The median follow up was 6.4years. The median age was 61.5years (range, 29-90), and median body mass index (BMI) was 26.3. Fifty one percent of the patients presented left sided BC and 49% right sided. Different type of fractions were used: 46.5% of pts.: 50 (breast)+16Gy (boost) in 33fractions (fr), in 17.9%-50Gy/25fr, in 26.1%-40/15fr or 41.6Gy/13fr and in 9.5%: 30Gy/5fr. Acute dermatitis was present in 93% with a median of apparition of 4weeks, and only 2,8% grade 3. In multivariate analysis, the cup size had significant influence (p=0.0004) and the fractionation had a significative influence (p=0.0001). In the all patients' population, 94.1% of cases had no skin toxicity at 1year. No cardiac or pulmonary toxicity was reported. The median overall survival had not been reached at the end of follow-up. We observed 36 (3.6%) recurrences, as following: 30 local (breast) recurrences, 4 lymph node (LN), and 2pts experiencing both. Whole breast radiotherapy in the lateral decubitus position provides excellent results in terms of local control and survival. ILD is well tolerated with very good acute toxicity profile. No cardiac or pulmonary toxicity were observed in this study. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results.",skin_neoplasms

In 2016, we conducted an online survey with a national sample of parents of adolescents aged 11-17 years (n?= 1,253). Multivariable logistic regression assessed correlates of receiving counseling from a health care provider about any of the six skin cancer prevention (SCP) topics. Only half (49%) of parents recalled discussing any SCP topic with their child's provider; the prevalence was highest for sunscreen (39%) and lowest for indoor tanning (3%). Parents had greater odds of receiving counseling if they had a child with more sun-reactive skin (odds ratio [OR]?= 1.53); a family history of skin cancer (OR?= 1.38); or a higher quality relationship with the provider (OR?= 1.47; all p < .05).

The 65 selected patients were diagnosed with head basal cell carcinoma (BCC), during 2011-2013, and they underwent surgery. The excised tumor tissue fragments were processed for paraffin embedding and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Masson's trichrome with Aniline Blue, and Alcian Blue-Periodic Acid Schiff (AB-PAS). The youngest patient was 23 years old, while the oldest was 91 years. The facial BCC there was slightly higher prevalence in males of 34 out of 65 cases. Histopathologically, great varieties of morphological types have been identified in the 65 cases investigated. According to our data, by far the most common are nodular BCCs type, which represented 44.6% from the investigated cases, followed at some distance by morpheiform and superficial subtypes with 13.8% and 10.7%, respectively. The most rare cases of facial BCCs were: cystic, adenoid, fibroepithelial and basal with adnexal differentiation with in one single case each. Relatively rare were the following varieties: pigmented (four cases), combinations of several forms (four cases), metatypical (three cases), keratotic (three cases), and micronodular (two cases).

The ulcers failed to improve after 2 weeks' therapy. An incisional biopsy of the lesion revealed malignant melanoma. The patient received wide excision, skin grafting as well as biotherapy. The lesion was healed and no other metastasis has been founded until now. Clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion in distinguishing malignant melanoma from other more benign skin lesions of the foot.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of FDG-PET versus CT at initial staging of ALCL first presenting in the skin. Eleven cases of ALCL first presenting in the skin who underwent both FDG-PET and CT were retrospectively analysed. There were six males and five females, with a mean age of 59.7 years. Results of FDG-PET were compared with those of CT. Biopsy results of lesions served as a reference for the accuracy of PET and CT in the evaluation of local and metastatic lesions. In seven cases (64%), imaging revealed extracutaneous ALCL. FDG-PET results were concordant with CT results in five cases (45%); in four of these cases, FDG-PET was negative, consistent with CT, and one case had cutaneous and extracutaneous lesions detectable on both CT and FDG-PET. FDG-PET and CT were discordant in six cases (55%).

The curative use of a hydroactive colloid gel has previously been shown effective in the management of RIMD in breast cancer patients. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of this same gel but in the prevention of RIMD. A group of breast cancer patients who applied the hydroactive gel from start to end of post-lumpectomy radiotherapy (Preventive Hydrogel group) were compared with two groups of matched historical controls: a group applying a dexpanthenol cream throughout their therapy and a group applying first the dexpanthenol cream then, after 11-14 fractions of radiotherapy, the hydroactive gel (Curative Hydrogel group). All patients received identical fractionation regimen. The clinical outcomes were the incidence and time to onset of RIMD. After 25 fractions of radiotherapy (50?Gy), patients in the Preventive Hydrogel group (N?=?202) developed RIMD significantly less frequently and later than patients in the Dexpanthenol group (N?=?131; incidence?=?7% vs 35% respectively, odds ratios?=?7.27; probability of RIMD-free survival after 50?Gy?=?0.88 vs 0.62). There were no significant differences between the Preventive and the Curative Hydrogel group (N?=?87).

De novo HHV-8 tumors induced by RTX used for these indications have not been reported previously. This study was undertaken to evaluate de novo HHV-8 tumors induced by RTX. In this retrospective study, we investigated the clinical, virologic, and pathologic features of 5 HIV-negative male patients with HHV-8 tumors induced by RTX therapy. Patients were all immunocompromised by previous treatments, which consisted of steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, and received RTX for insufficient response, disease progression, or transplant rejection. They developed HHV-8 tumors a median of 4 months after beginning treatment with RTX (range 3-13 months). Four patients had at least 1 risk factor for HHV-8, including a high Fitzpatrick skin phototype (of >3) (n?= 3) and homosexuality (n = 1). Four patients developed KS (all 4 had skin lesions and 2 had visceral involvement), and 1 patient developed a solid primary effusion lymphoma. RTX was discontinued in all patients, and immunosuppressants were reduced when feasible. After a median follow-up of 20 months, 2 patients died. Remission of KS was complete in 1 patient and partial in 1 patient, and 1 patient had progression. Our findings indicate that patients who have a high skin phototype and are at risk of HHV-8 should be carefully screened for HHV-8 before RTX therapy.

Radiation lung toxicity was assessed using pulmonary function test (PFT) and high-resolution computerized tomography scan (HRCT) scan at baseline and 1 yearpost-RT in 18 patients. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Significance of the difference between pre- and post-RT PFT values was assessed using paired t-test. The dose prescription was 50Gy to the breast, chest wall or regional nodes and 61Gy to the tumour bed as SIB, delivered in 25 fractions.

The clavicula pro humero technique is a biologic option that has been used in the past, but there are only scant case reports and small series that comment on the results of the procedure. Because the longevity of children mandates a reconstruction with potential longevity not likely to be achieved by other techniques, the clavicula pro humero technique may be a potential option in selected patients. (1) How successful is the clavicula pro humero procedure in achieving local tumor control? (2) What is the frequency of nonunion? (3) What are the complications of the procedure? (4) What scores do patients achieve (on the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) after this procedure? Four university hospitals performed the clavicula pro humero technique in eight children aged 8 to 18 years between June 2006 and February 2014. During that period, general indications for this approach included all reconstructions of the proximal humerus for malignant tumors in children older than 8 years. All patients were followed for a mean of 40 months (range, 25-86 months); one patient was lost to followup before 2 years. The tumor resections removed the rotator cuff muscles in all patients, glenohumeral joint in five, and deltoid muscle in three. The median length of the bone defect after resection was 20 cm (range, 7-25 cm). It was reduced to 9 cm (range, 0-17 cm) or 27% (range, 0%-64%) of the total humerus length after clavicular rotation. Direct osteosynthesis (one patient), induced membrane technique (one patient), or vascularized fibular autograft (six patients) was used to complete the defect after rotation of the clavicle if necessary. Presence of union (defined as bone healing before 10?months, as assessed by disappearance of the osteotomy on AP and lateral view radiographs), and complications were determined by chart review performed by a surgeon not involved in patient care. Function assessed by the MSTS and the TESS scores were determined by the patients with their families. None of the patients had tumor recurrence. One patient died of pulmonary metastases before the 2-year followup. Proximal and distal bone unions were achieved before 10?months without an additional surgical procedure in two and six of seven patients, respectively. Fourteen local complications occurred resulting in nine revision operations. The main complication was aseptic proximal pseudarthrosis (five patients); other complications included one proximal junction fracture, one clavicle fracture complicated by clavicle osteolysis, one distal junction fracture, one necrosis of the skin paddle of the fibular autograft, one glenoclavicular ossification, and one distal pseudarthrosis complicated by a fracture of this distal junction. Function, as assessed by the MSTS score, was a median of 23 of 30 (range, 11-27). The median TESS score was 82% (range, 75%-92%). Shoulder ROM (median; range) in abduction, front elevation, and external and internal rotations were 70??(30??-90??), 75??(30??-85??), 10??(0??-20??), and 80??(80??-100??), respectively. Three of the seven patients reported dissatisfaction with the cosmetic appearance. The clavicula pro humero technique achieved oncologic local control after resection and reconstruction of proximal humerus tumors in children. Although union times are approximately 2?years and some patients underwent augmentation with other grafts, it eventually provides a solid, painless, biologic, and stable reconstruction and creates a mobile acromioclavicular joint and generally good function. Nonunion of the proximal junction is the main complication of this technique. We cannot directly compare this technique with other reconstruction options, and longer followup is needed, but this may be a useful reconstruction option to consider in select pediatric patients with sarcomas of the proximal humerus.

Using an original software, two separate 3D models were made after SPET and MSCT imaging and then merged into a hybrid 3D model which enabled precise visualization and localization of the SNL. In all cases the position of the SNL established by our method was successfully verified using a gamma probe. Duration of SNL identification and extirpation were significantly reduced in less than 10 minutes per patient. The reproducibility of this method was confirmed by precise identification and biopsy of the SNL. We found this integrated SPET/MSCT 3D model to be much faster and easier to use as compared with the ""classic"" method, which was based on a radioactivity detection probe. In addition, our method was reproducible, accurate and of low cost. In other words, the method described in this paper could be very useful for health facilities with modest budget, because it obviates the need for buying expensive integrated SPET/MSCT hybrid imaging systems while detecting SNLs more accurately and in shorter time.",skin_neoplasms

We investigated whether the frameshift nature of indel mutations, which create novel open reading frames and a large quantity of mutagenic peptides highly distinct from self, might contribute to the immunogenic phenotype. We analysed whole-exome sequencing data from 5777 solid tumours, spanning 19 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We compared the proportion and number of indels across the cohort, with a subset of results replicated in two independent datasets. We assessed in-silico tumour-specific neoantigen predictions by mutation type with pan-cancer analysis, together with RNAseq profiling in renal clear cell carcinoma cases (n=392), to compare immune gene expression across patient subgroups. Associations between indel burden and treatment response were assessed across four checkpoint inhibitor datasets. -4).

The authors performed a retrospective review from all patients with large facial benign cutaneous lesions who underwent ""SMISS"" approach for reconstruction between September 2013 and December 2014. The authors treated 47 patients (32 female and 15 male; mean age 23.5 years, range 9-50 years). Follow-up was for 12 months or longer. The mean length of major axis was 43.91?mm, minor axis 32.10?mm, and scar 66.91?mm.

A strict definition of definite paraneoplastic neuropathies is necessary to avoid confusion. With carcinoma, seronegative sensory neuronopathies and neuronopathies and anti-Hu and anti-CV2/Contactin Response Mediator Protein 5 antibodies are the most frequent. With lymphomas, most neuropathies occur with monoclonal gammopathy including AL amyloidosis, Polyneuropathy-Organomegaly-Endocrinopathy-M component-Skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, type I cryoglobulinemia and antimyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathies and Waldenstr?m's disease. Neuropathies improving with tumor treatment are occasional, occur with a variety of cancer and include motor neuron disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and nerve vasculitis. If antibodies toward intracellular antigens are well characterized, it is not the case for antibodies toward cell membrane proteins. Contactin-associated protein-2 antibodies occur with neuromyotonia and thymoma with the Morvan's syndrome in addition to Netrin 1 receptor antibodies but may not be responsible for peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. The treatment of AL amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome, anti-MAG neuropathy and cryoglobulinemia is now relatively well established. It is not the case with onconeural antibodies for which the rarity of the disorders and a short therapeutic window are limiting factors for the development of clinical trials.

However, the expression status of MAGL in clinical melanoma tissues and its clinicopathological significance remain unclear. To correlate the tumour expression status of MAGL with the clinicopathological information of patients with malignant melanoma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array screening was performed, and the results were validated using immunocytochemical analysis of tumour and non-tumour melanocytic cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining for MAGL was performed for 74 melanoma samples, including 48 primary and 26 metastatic tumours, in which the expression of MAGL was determined by evaluating the percentage of MAGL-positive tumour cells and the MAGL staining intensity. Finally, we analysed the association of MAGL expression status with tumour progression, tumour thickness and vascular invasion of the primary lesion. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that MAGL was expressed in all 12 melanoma cell lines, but not in normal human epidermal melanocytes. In the immunohistochemical analysis, positive staining for MAGL was noted in 32 of 48 (64.5%) primary lesions, 14 of 17 (82.4%) lymph node metastatic lesions and 7 of 9 (77.8%) skin metastatic lesions. Metastatic tumours had a significantly higher staining intensity (P = 0.033 for lymph node, P = 0.010 for skin). In the analysis of primary lesions, higher MAGL expression correlated with greater tumour thickness (P = 0.015) and the presence of vascular invasion (P = 0.017). On further evaluation of MAGL-positive primary lesions, staining intensity of MAGL tended to be higher in deeper areas of the tumour mass. The expression of MAGL in tumour cells reflects the aggressiveness of melanoma cells and may serve as a marker of tumour progression.",skin_neoplasms

Data from occupational skin cancer screenings were analysed in a cross-sectional study. Dermatologists performed whole body examinations and collected medical histories. Subjects comprised all employees (16-70 years) examined from 2006 to 2014. 'Atopy' was defined by clinical screening diagnosis and/or by participant-reported, pre-existing atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma or other specified allergies confirmed by a physician. Tentative screening diagnoses of skin cancer related to actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. The study cohort comprised 90 265 employees (mean age 43 ?? 11 years, 58.5% male), 30.7% of whom were ever diagnosed with an atopic disease. Persons with atopic conditions recorded in their medical history and at the time of screening had a significantly lower prevalence of actinic keratosis (AK), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and MM. After controlling for age, sex and relevant risk factors (skin type, childhood sun burns), atopy remained significantly protective against BCC (OR 0.77) and MM (OR 0.53).

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 1,384 patients who were diagnosed with head and neck melanoma between 1976 and 2010 regarding prognostic factors [tumor thickness, level of invasion, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, ulceration, histological subtype, localization, and gender], overall survival, and disease-free survival. Patients who developed metastases had a significantly thicker tumor than patients without metastases. Additionally, a thicker tumor was often associated with a higher level of invasion (Clark level). There was no overall survival benefit in patients who underwent SLN dissection when compared to patients who did not (p=0.07). Compared to SLN-negative patients, patients with SLN involvement had a significantly shorter disease-free period (p<0.001) and shorter overall survival time (p<0.001).

The overall VAS-FA score was 94.1 implying excellent functional recovery. The use of free flaps to close defects after cancer resection can help preserve maximal extremity length and function. This approach does not have negative impact on overall outcome and further provide an increased quality of life with better function. Reconstruction using free flaps should be considered primarily when defects cannot be covered by conventional methods.",skin_neoplasms

In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, immunotherapy has not yet shown convincing efficacy in patients with UM. Combined immune checkpoint blockade with checkpoint programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and checkpoint cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibition has not been systematically assessed for UM to date. Patients with metastatic UM treated with either PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy or combined PD-1 inhibitor and ipilimumab (an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) were included from 20 German skin cancer centres. Records from 96 cases were analysed for treatment outcomes. Clinical and blood parameters associated with overall survival (OS) or treatment response were identified with multivariate Cox regression and binary logistic regression. Eighty-six patients were treated with PD-1 inhibitors only (n?=?54 for pembrolizumab, n?=?32 for nivolumab) with a centrally confirmed response rate of 4.7%. Median OS was 14 months for pembrolizumab-treated and 10 months for nivolumab-treated patients (p?=?0.765). Fifteen patients were treated with combined immune checkpoint blockade with partial response observed in two cases. Median OS was not reached in this group. Multivariate Cox regression identified Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (p?=?0.002), elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p?=?0.002) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p?=?0.001), and a relative eosinophil count (REC) <1.5% (p?=?0.002) as independent risk factors for poor survival.

The clinical course is variable and reliable prognostic factors are scarce. Tumor angiogenesis has been shown to have prognostic impact in different types of cancer. The aim of our study was to determine potential prognostic factors, including tumor vascularization, for clinical outcome of MCC. The medical records of 46 patients with MCC diagnosed between 1997 and 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Tissue samples were immune-stained for the lymphatic endothelial vessel marker podoplanin/D2-40 and the panvascular marker CD31. These immunostained sections were analyzed using computer-assisted morphometric image analyses. Aside from the parameters of tumor vascularization, clinicopathologic features were investigated, and progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor-specific survival (TSS) were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors. Male sex of the MCC patients and a high cross-sectional whole vessel area (WVA) in relation to the entire tumor area as determined on CD31-stained tumor sections were found to be negative prognostic factors for PFS in a univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Ulceration of the primary tumor was significantly associated with both impaired PFS and TSS. Our results indicate a high prognostic impact of tumor vascularization on the clinical outcome of MCC patients. Male sex and ulceration of the primary MCC were identified as independent unfavorable prognostic markers for the clinical outcome. As an outlook, MCC patients with increased angiogenesis might be identified and subjected to a targeted anti-angiogenic treatment.",skin_neoplasms
28637487,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) #162200) is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumour predisposition syndrome. Heritable constitutional mutations in the NF1 gene result in dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway and are causative of NF1. The major known function of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin is to downregulate RAS. NF1 exhibits variable clinical expression and is characterized by benign cutaneous lesions including neurofibromas and caf?-au-lait macules, as well as a predisposition to various types of malignancy, such as breast cancer and leukaemia. However, acquired somatic mutations in NF1 are also found in a wide variety of malignant neoplasms that are not associated with NF1. Capitalizing upon the availability of next-generation sequencing data from cancer genomes and exomes, we review current knowledge of somatic NF1 mutations in a wide variety of tumours occurring at a number of different sites: breast, colorectum, urothelium, lung, ovary, skin, brain and neuroendocrine tissues, as well as leukaemias, in an attempt to understand their broader role and significance, and with a view ultimately to exploiting this in a diagnostic and therapeutic context. As neurofibromin activity is a key to regulating the RAS/MAPK pathway, NF1 mutations are important in the acquisition of drug resistance, to BRAF, EGFR inhibitors, tamoxifen and retinoic acid in melanoma, lung and breast cancers and neuroblastoma. Other curiosities are observed, such as a high rate of somatic NF1 mutation in cutaneous melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian carcinoma and glioblastoma which are not usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Somatic NF1 mutations may be critical drivers in multiple cancers. The mutational landscape of somatic NF1 mutations should provide novel insights into our understanding of the pathophysiology of cancer. The identification of high frequency of somatic NF1 mutations in sporadic tumours indicates that neurofibromin is likely to play a critical role in development, far beyond that evident in the tumour predisposition syndrome NF1.",skin_neoplasms

Total of 8 patients were male and 5 were female, ranging in age from 1 to 56 years. Lesions appeared as isolated nodules or plaques on the trunk (7 cases), the limbs (4 cases) and the neck (2 cases). Histologically, all cases were composed of bundles of bland spindle cells of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lineage irregularly branching within the reticular dermis and along fibrous septa in the subcutis. Adnexal structures and dermal adipocytes were entrapped by the fascicles, the epidermis was often papillomatous and elastic fibers were decreased and fragmented. Expression of CD34 and ASMA was found in 8 and 7 cases, respectively. Follow-up was available for 7 patients (mean follow-up, 5 years; range, 1-10 years). None of the cases metastasized or recurred, even when incompletely excised. The differential diagnosis of FCTN is broad and includes hypertrophic scar, dermatofibroma, dermatomyofibroma, pilar leiomyoma, plaque-stage DFSP, CD34-positive plaque-like dermal fibroma, fibroblastic-predominant plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, lipofibromatosis, superficial desmoid fibromatosis and fibrous hamartoma of infancy, of which it represents probably the monophasic variant.",skin_neoplasms

Mortality information, including causes of death, was collected up to 31 December 2014. Age-standardised cause-specific mortality rates were calculated for selected causes of death, and included trends over time and comparison with the general population. In total, 2322 persons (42.3% of the sample) died, with 2170 (93.5%) having a reliable cause of death established.

PLK-1 expression in cancer cells was not associated with basic clinical (eg, age, gender and tumor location) or histopathological (eg, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate and ulceration) parameters. However, increased PLK-1 was more frequent in tumors with concurrent regional nodal metastases and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy status. All primary tumors associated with co-existing distant metastases exhibited high PLK-1 expression in melanoma cells.

Chi-squared analysis was used to analyse patient demographics and primary tumour pathology. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Over a sixteen-year period 1527 patients underwent SLNB in 1609 basins, with 2876 nodes harvested. 347 patients (23%) had a positive biopsy. The most common primary tumour sites for males was the back (32%); women had a significantly higher number of melanomas occurring on the lower and upper limbs (45% and 26% respectively) [all p?<?0.0001, Chi-squared]. Mean follow-up time was 4.9 years. Patients with a positive SLNB at diagnosis were significantly more likely to die from melanoma (subhazard ratio 5.59, p?=?0.000, 95% CI 3.59-8.69). Breslow thickness and ulceration were also significant predictors of melanoma-specific mortality. For patients with a primary Breslow >4.0?mm ten-year disease free survival was 52% for SLNB negative and 26% for SLNB positive patients.

Thus, follow-up is highly variable among institutions and individual providers. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends routine clinical examination and consideration of imaging for stage IIB-IIIC every 3-12?mo with no distinction between stages. Detection of recurrence is important as novel systemic therapies and surgical resection of recurrence may provide survival benefits. We retrospectively reviewed 369 patients with stage II and III melanoma treated at Ohio State University from 2009-2015, who underwent surgery as primary therapy. Two hundred forty-seven patients who were followed for a minimum of 6?mo after surgical resection to achieve no evidence of disease status (NED) were included in this analysis. One hundred twenty-two were lost to follow-up after surgery and were excluded. The rate of recurrence for stage IIA/IIB patients was 11% (14/125). Eleven of the 14 (79%) recurrences were detected by clinical symptoms or physical examination. Thirty-nine percent (49/125) of stage IIA or IIB patients were followed by clinical examination only, whereas 61% (76/125) were followed with at least two serial chest x-rays. The median time to first chest x-ray after NED status was 4.7?mo (n?=?76), median time to second chest x-ray after NED status was 12.7?mo (n?=?76), and 66% (50/76) continued to have additional serial chest x-rays.

For stage IIC/IIIA-C patients, recurrence was detected in 23% (28/122) at median follow-up 31.2?mo. Fifty percent of recurrences were detected by imaging in asymptomatic patients, whereas 50% (14/28) had recurrence detected on imaging associated clinical findings. Eighty-seven percent (106/122) of stage IIC/IIIA-C patients were followed with at least two serial whole body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) scans or whole body CT scans plus brain magnetic resonance imaging; median time between NED status and second scan was 10.3?mo.

However, the role of PD-L1 expression with regard to response to checkpoint inhibition with anti-CTLA-4 is not clear, yet. In addition, the lack of standardization in the immunohistochemical assessment of PD-L1 makes the comparison of results difficult. In this study, we investigated the PD-L1 gene expression with a new fully automated technique via RT-PCR and correlated the findings with the response to the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab. Within a retrospective multi-center trial, PD-L1 gene expression was evaluated in 78 melanoma patients in a total of 111 pre-treatment tumor samples from 6 skin cancer centers and analyzed with regard to response to ipilimumab. For meaningful statistical analysis, the cohort was enriched for responders with 30 responders and 48 non-responders. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR after extracting mRNA from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue and correlated with results from immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings. The evaluation of PD-L1 expression based on mRNA level is feasible. Correlation between PD-L1 expression as assessed by IHC and RT-PCR showed varying levels of concordance depending on the antibody employed.

Standard single venous cannulation was used in five cases, and extended, double venous cannulation in the last four. The standard technique for brachial vein cannulation in a small compartment of the upper extremity entails a problematic and longer perfusion of the upper extremity. This is due to the lower flow rate in the venous system and relatively large surface area with respect to weight. We present a simple technique based on a ""Y"" cannulation of the venous system via the deep brachial vein and superficial venous system via the basilic vein, delivering a 20% increase in flow rate in the extracorporeal circulation. Faster heating of the upper extremity and a stable thermal environment throughout upper-extremity ILP are essential for successful treatment.

28601296,"The aim of this study was to integrate the available data published on calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors (CEOT) into a comprehensive analysis of its clinical and radiologic features. An electronic search was undertaken in May 2016. Eligibility criteria were publications having enough clinical, radiological and/or histological information to confirm definite diagnosis. A total of 362 lesions were found, 339 with enough information were analyzed. Variants clear cells (n?=?33) and Langerhans cells (n?=?10) were rarely described in the literature, as well as lesions with malignant transformation (n?=?8). Central lesions (n?=?264) were more prevalent than their peripheral counterparts (n?=?24). A higher prevalence characterized the mandible, posterior region, and third and fourth decades. About 40% of the peripheral lesions showed signs of underlying bone erosion, and about half of the central ones showed signs of cortical bone perforation. Recurrence was found in all lesions (12.6%), peripheral lesions (18.8%), central lesions (11.6%), clear cell (10.7%), Langerhans cell (0%), and those with malignant transformation (42.9%). Excision or curettage was associated with the highest recurrence rate. None of the variables showed a statistically significant influence on the recurrence rate. The possible locally aggressive behavior of the lesions recommends a less conservative management than simple curettage. The clear cell variant shows similar demographic data and biological behavior compared to the non-variant lesions, suggesting that the presence of clear cells does not have an important clinical significance.",skin_neoplasms
28600236,"Segmentation of skin lesions is an important step in the automated computer aided diagnosis of melanoma. However, existing segmentation methods have a tendency to over- or under-segment the lesions and perform poorly when the lesions have fuzzy boundaries, low contrast with the background, inhomogeneous textures, or contain artifacts. Furthermore, the performance of these methods are heavily reliant on the appropriate tuning of a large number of parameters as well as the use of effective preprocessing techniques, such as illumination correction and hair removal. We propose to leverage fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to automatically segment the skin lesions. FCNs are a neural network architecture that achieves object detection by hierarchically combining low-level appearance information with high-level semantic information. We address the issue of FCN producing coarse segmentation boundaries for challenging skin lesions (e.g., those with fuzzy boundaries and/or low difference in the textures between the foreground and the background) through a multistage segmentation approach in which multiple FCNs learn complementary visual characteristics of different skin lesions; early stage FCNs learn coarse appearance and localization information while late-stage FCNs learn the subtle characteristics of the lesion boundaries. We also introduce a new parallel integration method to combine the complementary information derived from individual segmentation stages to achieve a final segmentation result that has accurate localization and well-defined lesion boundaries, even for the most challenging skin lesions. We achieved an average Dice coefficient of 91.18% on the ISBI 2016 Skin Lesion Challenge dataset and 90.66% on the PH2 dataset. Our extensive experimental results on two well-established public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art methods for skin lesion segmentation.",skin_neoplasms

Literature was searched, experts in the field of myofascial therapy were consulted and pilot testing was performed. 2) Thirty patients (63% had a mastectomy, 37% breast-conserving surgery and 97% radiotherapy) with myofascial adhesions were evaluated using the developed tool by 2 independent raters. The Weighted Kappa (WK) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. 1) The evaluation tool for Myofascial Adhesions in Patients with Breast Cancer (MAP-BC evaluation tool) consisted of the assessment of myofascial adhesions at 7 locations: axillary and breast region scars, musculi pectorales region, axilla, frontal chest wall, lateral chest wall and the inframammary fold. At each location the degree of the myofascial adhesion was scored at three levels (skin, superficial and deep) on a 4-points scale (between no adhesions and very stiff adhesions). Additionally, a total score (0-9) was calculated, i.e. the sum of the different levels of each location. 2) Interrater agreement of the different levels separately was moderate for the axillary and mastectomy scar (WK 0.62-0.73) and good for the scar on the breast (WK >0.75). Moderate agreement was reached for almost all levels of the non-scar locations. Interrater reliability of the total scores was the highest for the scars (ICC 0.82-0.99). At non-scar locations good interrater reliability was reached, except for the inframammary fold (ICC = 0.71). The total scores of all locations of the MAP-BC evaluation tool had good to excellent interrater reliability, except for the inframammary fold which only reached moderate reliability.",skin_neoplasms

A common treatment strategy for these patients is facial nerve preservation surgery, although the degree to which the nerve is successfully preserved is still unclear. Data on the incidence and recovery of facial nerve dysfunction are woefully lacking in the field of dermato-oncology. In 23 patients with normal preoperative facial nerve function, we retrospectively reviewed twenty-six head and neck surgical interventions that included facial nerve exposure and protection, focusing particularly on the differences in outcome between intraparotid and extraparotid exposure of the facial nerve branches. Eleven of the 26 cases (42.4%) developed transient paresis, but only one (3.8%) developed permanent paresis. Of 41 dissected facial nerve branches, 14 developed transient paresis (34.1%) and one, a marginal mandibular branch, developed permanent paresis (2.4%). The branches most susceptible to developing paresis were the temporal (4/6 branches, 66.7%) and marginal mandibular branches (8/17 branches, 47.1%). Although the rate of paresis was higher, and ensuing recovery period slightly longer in the extraparotid dissection group compared to the intraparotid dissection group, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The extraparotid and intraparotid rates of paresis were 48% (11/23 branches) and 21.1% (4/19 branches), respectively, P?=?0.139; and the average recovery periods were 10.3 and 9.3?weeks, respectively, P?=?0.64.

We evaluated changes in serum IL-8 levels as a biomarker of response to anti-PD-1 blockade in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Metastatic melanoma and NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab were studied. Serum was collected at baseline; at 2-4?weeks after the first dose; and at the time-points of response evaluation. Serum IL-8 levels were determined by sandwich ELISA. Changes in serum IL-8 levels were compared with the Wilcoxon test and their strength of association with response was assessed with the Mann-Whitney test. Accuracy of changes in IL-8 levels to predict response was estimated using receiver operation characteristics curves. Twenty-nine melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab were studied. In responding patients, serum IL-8 levels significantly decreased between baseline and best response (P?<0.001), and significantly increased upon progression (P?=??0.004). In non-responders, IL-8 levels significantly increased between baseline and progression (P?=??0.013). Early changes in serum IL-8 levels (2-4?weeks after treatment initiation) were strongly associated with response (P?<0.001). These observations were validated in 19 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab (P?=??0.001), and in 15 melanoma patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (P?<0.001). Early decreases in serum IL-8 levels were associated with longer overall survival in melanoma (P?=??0.001) and NSCLC (P?=??0.015) patients. Serum IL-8 levels also correctly reflected true response in three cancer patients presenting pseudoprogression.

Prospective, single-blinded, questionnaire study of 173 patients undergoing MMS of the face. Anxiety levels were assessed using a visual analog scale preoperatively and postoperatively over 6 months. Mohs patients demonstrate a trend to greater or equal anxiety about cancer over cosmesis at all measured time points, but differences only reached statistical significance beginning 1 week postoperatively. Clinically relevant lowering of cancer anxiety levels is delayed until 3 months postoperatively. Cosmetic anxiety reaches a clinically relevant improvement by 1 week. The intuitive predictors of cosmetic anxiety, namely female gender and younger age, were quantitatively reinforced in this study. The predictor of cancer anxiety was the use of preoperative lorazepam. To maximize patient care, Mohs surgeons must be aware of covert patient anxieties and the parameters, which influence these anxieties.

Tumors with high angiogenic activity belong to the category of aggressive tumors with poor prognosis for patients. The aim of this study was to determine the blood vessels density (BVD), i.e. neovascularization at the tumor invasive front in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in order to determine its possible role in the tumor progression, and to correlate it to the blood vessels density of healthy skin and with the prognostic parameters of the TNM classification: T status, depth of tumor invasion (DI) and tumor histological grade (G), which were also correlated between each other. The material consisted of surgical specimens obtained from 30 patients with skin SCC, who underwent surgery. Tissue samples were routinely processed by standard paraffin technique stained by Hematoxilin-Eosin and immunohistochemically with antibodies against smooth muscle actin (SMA) and CD34. The BVD in the invasive front of the neoplasms was correlated to the healthy skin, tumor status (pT), depth of invasion and grade of histological differentiation (pG). The histological analysis has shown a high statistical difference in the density of blood vessels in SCC compared to the healthy skin and statistical difference in BVD in neoplasms with different depth of invasion and different grade of differentiation. The density of neovascularzation increased with the deeper invasion and the worse differentiation. The increased vascularization at the invasive front of SCC with deeper invasion and worse differentiation has pointed out to its possible role in neoplasm progression.",skin_neoplasms

In this pilot interventional study performed at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, patients 35 years or older scheduled for an annual health habits screen in the PCP general medicine clinics were studied. Six PCPs underwent Internet Curriculum for Melanoma Early Detection (INFORMED) training in May 2015, and 5 screened patients during the following 14 months. Proportion of dermatology referrals, subsequent skin biopsies, and PCP diagnostic accuracy for skin cancer or precancer compared with dermatologist diagnosis were assessed in screened patients 14 months before the intervention (February 18, 2014, through April 30, 2015) and after the intervention (June 18, 2015, through August 30, 2016). Among 258 patients offered screening (median age, 70 years; age range, 35-94 years; 255 [98.8%] male), 189 (73.3%) received CSE and 69 (26.7%) declined. A total of 62 of 189 patients (32.8%) were referred to a dermatologist after intervention: 33 (53.2%) for presumptive skin cancers and 15 (24.2%) for precancers. Nine of 50 patients (18.0%) evaluated in dermatology clinic underwent biopsy to exclude skin cancer. Correct diagnoses were made by PCPs in 13 of 38 patients (34.2%; 4 of 27 patients [14.8%] diagnosed with skin cancers and 5 of 11 patients [45.5%] diagnosed with actinic keratoses). Comparison of all outpatient visits for the 5 main participating PCPs before vs after intervention revealed no significant differences in dermatology referrals overall and those for presumptive skin cancer or actinic keratoses, skin biopsies, or PCP diagnostic accuracy with the exception of significantly fewer postintervention dermatology referrals that lacked specific diagnoses (25 [1.0%] vs 10 [0.4%], P?=?.01). This pilot study suggests that PCP-based skin cancer training and screening are feasible and have the potential to improve PCP diagnostic accuracy without increasing specialty referrals or skin biopsies.

Ninety-nine patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer were examined. Patient history with respect to UV exposure was obtained using the online UV history tool. Initial validation was carried out with data from ten additional patients. In the context of a pilot study, the applicability of the tool was assessed using a questionnaire. Overall, patient history revealed a UV exposure between 3,792 and 53,163?SEDs. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, or Bowen's disease (n? = ?22) had significantly higher SED values and were significantly older (73 vs. 66 years) than patients with basal cell carcinoma (n? = ?77). Occupational UV exposure was reported by 19 patients, two of whom showed an additional occupational UV exposure of more than 40?%, which prompted the filing of a (suspected) occupational disease report.

Currently, staging of patients with primary melanoma is performed using histological biomarkers such as tumor thickness and ulceration. As disruption of the epigenomic landscape is recognized as a widespread feature inherent in tumor development and progression, we aimed to identify novel biomarkers providing additional clinical information over current factors using unbiased genome-wide DNA methylation analyses. We performed a comprehensive DNA methylation analysis during all progression stages of melanoma using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips on a discovery cohort of benign nevi (n?=?14) and malignant melanoma from both primary (n?=?33) and metastatic (n?=?28) sites, integrating the DNA methylome with gene expression data. We validated the discovered biomarkers in three independent validation cohorts by pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry. We identified and validated biomarkers for, and pathways involved in, melanoma development (e.g., HOXA9 DNA methylation) and tumor progression (e.g., TBC1D16 DNA methylation). In addition, we determined a prognostic signature with potential clinical applicability and validated PON3 DNA methylation and OVOL1 protein expression as biomarkers with prognostic information independent of tumor thickness and ulceration. Our data underscores the importance of epigenomic regulation in triggering metastatic dissemination through the inactivation of central cancer-related pathways. Inactivation of cell-adhesion and differentiation unleashes dissemination, and subsequent activation of inflammatory and immune system programs impairs anti-tumoral defense pathways. Moreover, we identify several markers of tumor development and progression previously unrelated to melanoma, and determined a prognostic signature with potential clinical utility.",skin_neoplasms

After retrospectively identifying all DM cases with RCM data over the study period (n = 16), a control group of non-DM melanoma patients with RCM data, in a ratio of at least 3 : 1, was selected. The control group was matched by age and primary tumour site location, divided into non-DM invasive melanomas (n = 27) and MIS (n = 27). Invasive melanomas were selected according to the melanoma subtypes associated with the DM cases. The main outcomes were the frequency of melanoma-specific features on dermoscopy for DM; and the odds ratios of RCM features to distinguish DM from MIS and/or other invasive melanomas; or MIS from the combined invasive melanoma group. At least one of the 14 melanoma-specific features evaluated on dermoscopy was found in 100% of DMs (n = 15 DM with dermoscopy). Known RCM melanoma predictors were commonly found in the DMs, such as pagetoid cells (100%) and cell atypia (100%).

Clear resection margins and tumor free regional lymph nodes reduce recurrence and carcinoma related death. Although low-grade SCs were reported over 3 times more often, high-grade carcinomas show a greater likelihood for recurrence and lethal outcome. Suspicion of an SC should lead to performance of a magnetic resonance imaging for defining tumor extent, and a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT for detection of metastases. Radical tumor excision and resection of tumor involved regional lymph nodes are essential for a curative approach.

These may include inflammations, benign tumors, cysts, hematomas, or, more rarely, focal necrosis. This report presents a case of focal breast necrosis following myocardial revascularization with the left internal mammary artery, which is a very rare condition, with only few cases described in the literature. The necrosis becomes usually apparent a few days or weeks after the surgery and is often coincidental with the dehiscence of sternotomy with necrosis of wound edges. As it mostly affects the skin, it can be easily recognized. Also, our patient developed a dehisced sternotomy shortly after the surgery but there were no obvious objective changes on the breast. The condition was first dominated only by non-specific subjective symptom-pain. Later, a lump in the breast occurred, when the sternotomy had already healed. Moreover, an enlarged lymph node was palpable in the axilla. Because of non-typical symptoms, the condition was suggestive of breast cancer for a relatively long time. The patient had suffered from a very strong pain until she was treated by mastectomy with a good clinical result. Mammary necrosis following the coronary artery bypass is rare.

Congenital hemangiomas (16 cases) and kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas (62 cases) were all negative for GLUT1. Angiosarcomas were GLUT1 positive in 12/39 (31%) and epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas in 2/27 (7%) of cases. Vascular malformations: All vascular malformations (33 arteriovenous malformations, 16 capillary malformations, 64 lymphatic malformations, 54 venous malformations, 3 venous-lymphatic malformations and 3 capillary venous-lymphatic malformations) were negative for GLUT1 staining. Unclassified vascular anomalies: Angiokeratomas were GLUT1 positive in 1/15 (7%) and verrucous hemangiomas in 71/100 (71%) of cases. Microvenular hemangiomas were negative for GLUT1 in all 9 cases. GLUT1 can be used as an additional diagnostic tool in cutaneous vascular lesions. A negative GLUT1 stain renders a diagnosis of infantile hemangioma unlikely. A positive GLUT1 stain excludes vascular malformations and is suggestive of infantile hemangioma. One must be cautious, however, that the final diagnosis is made through interpretation of all clinical and diagnostic features, and not based on GLUT1 staining alone.",skin_neoplasms
28551623,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance (DFSP) is a fibrohistiocytic tumor of intermediate malignancy characterized by slow infiltrative growth and a high tendency to recur locally. Periostin is involved in modulating cell function and inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to promote fibrosis and tumor growth. This study aimed to examine the cancer stroma of DFSP, focusing on TAMs-related proteins and MMPs. Using immunohistochemical staining and DNA microarray database, we evaluated periostin, CD163, CD206, MMP1 and MMP12 in 10 cases of DFSP and dermatofibroma. + TAMs were detected at the peripheral areas of DFSP. Moreover, MMP1 and MMP12, that were selected by using a DNA microarray database of monocyte-derived macrophages, were observed in the TAMs-detected area. Increased levels of MMP1 and MMP12 on TAMs in the peripheral areas of DFSP might contribute to local invasion.",skin_neoplasms

In this feasibility trial, we investigated the prone position for whole breast?+?lymph node irradiation (WB?+?LNI). A new support device was developed for optimal target coverage, on which patients are positioned in a position resembling a phase from the crawl swimming technique (prone crawl position). Five left sided breast cancer patients were included and simulated in supine and prone position. For each patient, a treatment plan was made in prone and supine position for WB?+?LNI to the whole axilla and the unoperated part of the axilla. Patients served as their own controls for comparing dosimetry of target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) in prone versus in supine position. Target volume coverage differed only slightly between prone and supine position. Doses were significantly reduced (P?<?0.05) in prone position for ipsilateral lung (Dmean, D2, V5, V10, V20, V30), contralateral lung (Dmean, D2), contralateral breast (Dmean, D2 and for total axillary WB?+?LNI also V5), thyroid (Dmean, D2, V5, V10, V20, V30), oesophagus (Dmean and for partial axillary WB?+?LNI also D2 and V5), skin (D2 and for partial axillary WB?+?LNI V105 and V107). There were no significant differences for heart and humeral head doses. Prone crawl position in WB?+?LNI allows for good breast and nodal target coverage with better sparing of ipsilateral lung, thyroid, contralateral breast, contralateral lung and oesophagus when compared to supine position. There is no difference in heart and humeral head doses. No trial registration was performed because there were no therapeutic interventions.",skin_neoplasms

We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the relationship between HFS and efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients were treated with PLD between July 2009 and May 2014. We evaluated patient characteristics, incidence of adverse events, clinical benefit (rate of complete response, partial response, and stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. Median age was 63 years (range, 41-77 years). The median number of cycles of PLD was 3 (range, 1-6). The clinical benefit rate was 33.3%, and progressive disease was noted in 18 patients (66.7%). Median overall survival was 6.7 months (range, 1.1-41 months). Compared with patients with grade 0/1 HFS and oral mucositis, patients with grade 2-4 toxicity (n = 9, 33.3%) had a significantly higher rate of clinical benefit (11.1% vs 77.7%; P < 0.001) and a longer median overall survival (3.7 months vs 20.8 months; P < 0.001).

To assess the incidence of SCC in Guadeloupe, the largest island of the Lesser Antilles (405 000 inhabitants, mostly Black people of African and European descent). The second objective was to characterize clinical and histological patterns of SCC occurring in the Afro-Caribbean community. This retrospective study was conducted over an 11-year period (2000-2010). Data regarding 723 histological confirmed cases of SCC identified using the three Guadeloupean pathology laboratories' computerized databases were retrieved from the records of 551 patients. Private practice dermatologists and general practitioners were contacted to obtain any missing data. The annual age-adjusted incidence of SCC was 15 per 100.000 residents in Guadeloupe. In the Afro-Caribbean community, SCC had a greater size (i.e. 2.8 ? 2.8 cm vs. 1.5 ? 1.0 cm, P < 0.001), was more often located on the anogenital area (i.e. 48/79-60.8% vs. 14/320-4.4%, P < 0.001) in association with an underlying dermatosis due to HPV infection (15/71-21.1% vs. 3/366, 0.8%, P < 0.001) and led more frequently to metastasis (13/84-15.5% vs. 10/366-2.7%, P < 0.001) and/or fatal evolution (11/83-13.3% vs. 7/365-1.9%, P < 0.001). The results of this original study, which first estimated the incidence of SCC in West Indies, suggest that anogenital examination should be routinely performed in skin cancer screening of Afro-Caribbean people to detect the presence of SCC at an early stage. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent skin cancer in Black people. Its incidence is not known in the Afro-Caribbean population. In Guadeloupe, the largest island of the Lesser Antilles, the annual age-adjusted incidence of SCC was estimated to be 15.0 per 100 000 residents, 95% CI:[13.8; 16.2].

28543532,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive cutaneous carcinoma. MCC typically involves dermis and although epidermotropism has been reported, MCC strictly intraepidermal or in situ (MCCIS) is exceedingly rare. Most of the cases of MCCIS described so far have other associated lesions, such as squamous or basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and so on. Herein, we describe 3 patients with MCC strictly in situ, without a dermal component. Our patients were elderly. 2 of the lesions involved the head and neck area and 1 was on a finger. All tumors were strictly intraepidermal in the diagnostic biopsies, and had histomorphologic features and an immunohistochemical profile supporting the diagnosis of MCC. Excisional biopsies were performed in 2 cases and failed to reveal dermal involvement by MCC or other associated malignancies. Our findings raise the awareness that MCC strictly in situ does exist and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of Paget's or extramammary Paget's disease, pagetoid squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and other neoplasms that typically show histologically pagetoid extension of neoplastic cells. Considering the limited number of cases reported to date, the diagnosis of isolated MCCIS should not warrant a change in management from the typical MCC.",skin_neoplasms
28540796,"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) is a treatment option for patients with in-transit metastases of malignant melanoma in the extremities, as well as locally advanced sarcoma. ILP allows for a delivery of high-dose chemotherapy to an isolated extremity with minimal systemic toxicity. However, local toxicity like oedema, blistering, nerve damage and compartment syndrome can occur. Myoglobin measurements have been used as a screening method to predict the most severe cases of local toxicity. The aim was to investigate if myoglobin is a predictive factor for local toxicity after ILP in patients with melanoma in-transit metastases. One hundred and ninety-three patients were treated for the first time with ILP for in-transit metastases between 2001 and 2015. Myoglobin was measured once the first hours after the perfusion (POD0), and for the first five post-operative days (POD1-5). Local toxicity was graded according to Wieberdink, and grouped in mild (I and II), moderate (III), and severe (IV and V). Wieberdink-groups were compared with myoglobin measurements, and myoglobin measurements were compared between gender, perfusion time, perfusion temperature and cannulated vessels. There is no statistically significant difference in myoglobin serum levels during the first five days post perfusion between patients suffering from mild, moderate or severe local toxicity. There is no difference between toxicity groups when it comes to distribution of sex, tumour size, or tumour numbers.

A 5% significance level was used. Of 261 health gents selected, 243 were able to participate in the study. The prevalence rate of sunscreen use was 34.2% (95% CI: 28.2-40.2). Factors associated with sunscreen use were female sex, advanced age, use of sunscreen in situations when the skin got burnt, knowledge of the negative effects of the sun on the skin and skin cancer history.

The objective of this work was to identify a potential biomarker in the urine of children with infantile hemangiomas that would facilitate testing new therapies. A prospective longitudinal study in children with hemangiomas and age-matched healthy controls was performed to determine whether microRNA-126, which is highly abundant in fetal endothelial cells, was more abundant in the urine of affected children. Prospective ultrasound measurements of hemangioma size and blood flow velocity were obtained as secondary endpoints to document longitudinal changes in untreated hemangiomas. Urinary microRNA-126 levels were significantly elevated in children with proliferating hemangiomas, and relative levels of urinary microRNA abundance correlated with hemangioma size. Hemangiomas had elevated levels of microRNA abundance compared with healthy controls. Ultrasound data revealed that hemangioma proliferation typically stopped between 6 and 9 months of age. When hemangioma proliferation stopped, urinary microRNA-126 levels in children with hemangiomas dropped to levels observed in healthy age-matched controls. These are the first reported results to identify a potential microRNA biomarker in the urine of children with hemangiomas. Measurement of urinary levels of microRNA-126 could potentially be used to monitor hemangioma response to therapies. Diagnostic, II.",skin_neoplasms

28537531,"The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway is a novel therapeutic target in immune checkpoint therapy for cancer. It consists of the PD-1 receptor and its two ligands, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2). Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for malignant melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan. Thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism have both been reported in international Phase 3 studies and national post-marketing surveillance of nivolumab in Japan. This study analyzed five consecutive cases with thyroid dysfunction associated with nivolumab therapy. Second, it examined the mRNA and protein expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. All patients were diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. Thyrotoxicosis developed within four weeks from the first administration of nivolumab and normalized within four weeks of onset in three of the five patients. Hypothyroidism after transient thyrotoxicosis developed in two patients, and preexisting hypothyroidism persisted in one patient. The other two patients were treated with glucocorticoids and discontinued nivolumab therapy for comorbid adverse events. One did not develop hypothyroidism, and the other developed mild, transient hypothyroidism. In addition, it was verified that normal thyroid tissue expresses PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA and those proteins. In the present cases, nivolumab-induced thyrotoxicosis seemed to be associated with painless thyroiditis, while no patient with Graves' disease was observed. A transient and rapid course with subsequent hypothyroidism was observed in nivolumab-induced thyroiditis. In addition, it was verified that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in normal thyroid tissue. This suggests that nivolumab therapy reduces immune tolerance, even in normal thyroid tissue, and leads to the development of thyroiditis. Treating thyrotoxicosis with only supportive care and considering levothyroxine replacement therapy once subsequent hypothyroidism occurs is proposed. Further investigations are required to confirm whether glucocorticoid therapy and discontinuation of nivolumab therapy prevent subsequent hypothyroidism.",skin_neoplasms

Two of the six known MT-MMPs are anchored to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor, one of which is MT4-MMP. Only little is known about MT4-MMP expression, synthesis, regulation and degradation. We analyzed several human cancer cell lines as well as tissue homogenates using Western blotting and quantitative PCR for the expression of MT4-MMP. Organelles of SK-Mel-28 cells were separated using continuous Iodixanol gradients. Glycosylation of the SK-Mel-28 protein was studied via glucosidases and site directed mutagenesis of the MT4-MMP cDNA prior to transfection. We found the MT4-MMP highly expressed in human melanoma cell lines as well as skin and melanoma tissue samples. Three forms of MT4-MMP with molecular masses of 45 kDa, 58 kDa and 69 kDa were detected. Further, we demonstrate that the 58 kDa form is the mature protein in the cell membrane, while the 69 kDa form is its precursor found in intracellular compartments. The 69 kDa forms are processed by furin cleavage in the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, we identified Asn318 as the single N-glycosylation site of MT4-MMP.

The present study examined parental and child correlates of skin cancer-related behaviors (sunburns, sunbathing, sun-protective clothing use, and sunscreen use) of children of Hispanic parents. This survey study included a population-based sample of 360 U.S. Hispanic parents (44.8% male) who had a child 14?years of age or younger. Measures included parental reports of parent and child demographic characteristics, parent skin cancer knowledge and linguistic acculturation, and parent and child skin cancer-related behaviors.

At the same time, the incidence of skin cancers, including melanoma, has risen. The relatively few large-scale studies that linked ambient UVR to melanoma found a trend toward rising incidence closer to the equator, where UVR estimates are highest. Similar research has not been conducted in Canada, where ambient UVR is generally lower than in countries further south. Modelled UVR data for the months of June through August during the 1980-to-1990 period were spatially linked in Geographic Information Systems to 2.4 million white members of the 1991 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort and tracked for melanoma diagnosis over an 18-year period (1992 to 2009). Standard Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate melanoma risk associated with increases of ambient summer UVR, assigned by residence at baseline. Models were adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic (SES) characteristics. Separate analyses by body site of melanoma were conducted. Effect modification of the association between ambient UVR and melanoma by sex, age, outdoor occupation and selected SES characteristics was evaluated. Differences of one standard deviation (446 J/m??, or 7% of the mean) in average ambient summer UVR were associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for melanoma of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.25) when adjusting for sex, age and SES characteristics. The HR for melanoma in relative UVR (per 1 standard deviation) was larger for men (HR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.30) than for women (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.22).

The incidence of head and neck sarcoma rose substantially in older age groups (age 65 years and above) and was most common in male patients (69%). Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) was the most common pathology. There was an increase in incidence in skin-origin sarcoma in the head and neck, particularly affecting elderly males. The incidence of head and neck sarcoma in Australia is higher than that reported for an equivalent European population. The increase in MFH arising from the skin in elderly male patients mirrors the patterns of common cutaneous malignancy, particularly melanoma, suggesting that ultraviolet radiation is an epidemiological factor.

The morbidity rate of cSCC among the contingent of SIS in 2005-2014 increased from 6.7 per 100,000people to 37.1 per 100,000 people. Among men it increased from 8.2 per 100,000 people to 59.2 per 100,000 people, and among women - from 6.6 per 100,000 people to 19.2 per 100,000people. Among the contingent of SIS the highest incidence both in men and women was observed in the age group of 85 and upwards; among men it was 115.2 per 100,000 people, and among women - 112.0 per 100,000 people. The morbidity rate of cSCC among the contingent of SIS in 2005-2014 was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the morbidity rate among the population of Kyiv city and Kyiv region over the same period of time, with the prevalence of patients aged 85 and upwards, both men and women.",skin_neoplasms

Here we will review the current data evaluating immunotherapies in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings in uveal melanoma. In the adjuvant setting, interferon demonstrated no survival benefit in uveal melanoma, and studies evaluating immune-based strategies such as vaccine therapy are ongoing. Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade in uveal melanoma have been evaluated in several small prospective and/or retrospective studies with rare responses and no overall survival benefit demonstrated. Ongoing studies evaluating combination checkpoint inhibition and other antibody-based therapies are ongoing. Although immunotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents has dramatically changed the treatment approach to cutaneous melanoma, its success in uveal melanoma has been much more limited.

Data from three centers performing SLNB for LR/IT melanoma (1997 to the present) were reviewed, with the aim of assessing (1) success rate; (2) SLNB positivity; and (3) prognostic value of SLNB in this population. The study cohort included 107 patients. Management of the primary melanoma included prior SLNB for 56 patients (52%), of whom 10 (18%) were positive and 12 had complete lymph node dissections (CLNDs). In the present study, SLNB was performed for IT disease (48/107, 45%) or LR melanoma (59/107, 55%). A sentinel lymph node (SLN) was removed in 96% (103/107) of cases. Nodes were not removed for four patients due to lymphoscintigraphy failures (2) or nodes not found during surgery (2). SLNB was positive in 41 patients (40%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 31.5-50.5), of whom 35 (88%) had CLND, with 13 (37%) having positive nonsentinel nodes. Median time to disease progression after LR/IT metastasis was 1.4?years (95% CI 0.75-2.0) for patients with a positive SLNB, and?5.9?years (95% CI 1.7-10.2)?in SLNB-negative patients (p?=?0.18). There was a trend towards improved overall survival for patients with a negative SLNB (p?=?0.06). SLNB can be successful in patients with LR/IT melanoma, even if prior SLNB was performed. In this population, the rates of SLNB positivity and nonsentinel node metastases were 40% and 37%, respectively. SLNB may guide management and prognosis after LR/IT disease.",skin_neoplasms
28506450,"The supraclavicular island flap is a rotational pedicled flap and may have some advantages in head and neck reconstruction compared with free-tissue transfer when this kind of reconstruction is not affordable or recommended. We present our experience during the year 2016 in the application of the supraclavicular island flap in five cases as an alternative to microvascular reconstruction in several defects after resection of head and neck tumours. In two patients, the flap was used to close the surgical pharyngostoma after total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy. In one patient, it was used in lateral facial reconstruction after partial resection of the temporal bone. In one case, it was used to close a skin defect after total laryngectomy with prelaryngeal tissue extension. And in the last case to close a neck skin defect after primary closure of a pharyngo-cutaneous fistula. There were no flap complications, and the result was satisfactory in all cases. The supraclavicular artery island flap is useful and versatile in head and neck reconstruction. Operating room time in aged patients or those with comorbidities will be reduced compared to free flaps. The surgical technique is relatively easy and can be used for skin and mucosal coverage. The supraclavicular island flap could be a recommended option in head and neck reconstruction, its use seems to be increasing and provides a safe and time-saving option to free flaps in selected patients.",skin_neoplasms

An initial prototype consisting of four main pieces, one of which contains radioactive markers to make it visible in the PET images, was built using a 3D printer. Once the device is mounted, a spherical coordinate system is built with the entrance needle point in the skin as the origin of coordinates. Two in-house software programs, namely getCoord.ijm, which obtains the spherical coordinates of the tumour tissue to be biopsied, and getNeedle.ijm, which virtualizes the inner needle tip once the puncture has taken place, were written. This prototype was tested on an FDG-doped phantom to characterize both the accuracy of the system and the procedure time. Up to 11 complete biopsy procedures were conducted. The mean total procedure time was less than 20min, which is less than the procedure time of conventional standard CT-guided biopsies. The overall accuracy of the system was found to be 5.0??1.3mm, which outperforms the criterion used in routine clinical practice when targeting tumours with a diameter of 10mm.

Consecutive patients undergoing major HNC surgery between July 2007 and June 2012 were identified from our head and neck database. Patient demographics, tumour type, site, stage and types of resection and reconstruction, length of stay and surgical complications occurring within six months of initial surgery were retrospectively analysed. The actual cost of initial surgical treatment and hospital income were calculated. Two hundred and forty-five patients underwent major HNC surgery, most commonly for mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and metastatic and/or locally advanced cutaneous SCC. Neck dissection and parotidectomy were the commonest resection procedures and free flaps the commonest reconstructive procedures performed. Forty-two patients developed surgical complications within six months of the initial major HNC surgery. Over the five-year period, surgery cost a total of NZ$5,130,639.00, averaging NZ$20,941.38 per patient, not including costs such as incidentals, while the hospital received NZ$4,976,559.61 averaging NZ$20,229.91/patient. On average, oral cavity cancer, metastatic and/or locally advanced skin cancer, and skull base cancer cost NZ$22,694.72/patient, NZ$17,373.64/patient and NZ$47,295.95/patient, respectively.

The authors studied CTCL incidence and mortality in Canada using 3 distinct population-based cancer databases. Data on patients' sex, age at the time of diagnosis, subtype of CTCL malignancy, reporting province, city, and postal code were analyzed. CTCL cases were mapped across Canada using geographic information systems software. In total, 6685 patients with CTCL were identified in Canada during 1992 through 2010 (CTCL incidence rate, 11.32 cases per million individuals per year), of which 58% were males. The mean age at diagnosis was 59.4 ?? 21.5 years. Geographic analysis of patients revealed increased CTCL incidence on the provincial and city levels in several eastern provinces and in Manitoba. An analysis according to postal codes (Forward Sortation Area [FSA]) identified select communities in which several high-incidence FSAs were contiguous or adjacent. Several of these FSAs were located in industrial regions of Canadian cities. Conversely, 3 of 8 low-incidence FSAs were clustered in Ottawa, Ontario, which has very little industrial presence.

28492924,"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is commonly refractory to surgical and nonsurgical therapies. Identifying recurrent or persistent EMPD is challenging because the disease is multifocal, and multiple blind scouting biopsies are usually performed in this setting. Handheld reflectance confocal microscopy (HRCM) has been used to diagnose and map primary EMPD and therefore may be used to identify EMPD recurrences. To evaluate HRCM's diagnostic accuracy in the setting of recurrent or persistent EMPD as well as its potential diagnostic pitfalls. This prospective case series study included patients referred to the Dermatology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, with biopsy-proven EMPD in whom HRCM was used to monitor treatment response. Five patients were included, and 22 sites clinically concerning for recurrent or persistent disease were evaluated using HRCM and histopathologic examination. In 2 patients, video mosaics were created to evaluate large areas. Sensitivity and specificity of HRCM in identifying recurrent or persistent EMPD; causes for false-negative results according to their location, histopathologic findings, and previous treatments. Of the 22 clinically suspicious sites evaluated in 5 patients (4 men, 1 woman; median [range] age, 70 [56-77] years), 9 (40.9%) were positive for recurrent disease on HRCM and histopathologically confirmed, and 13 (59.1%) sites were negative on HRCM, but 3 of the 13 were positive for EMPD on histopathological examination. In general, HRCM had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100% in identifying recurrent or persistent EMPD. False-negative results were found in 2 patients and occurred at the margins of EMPD, close to previous biopsy sites.

As macroscopic observation may overlook symptoms during infusion, we focused on skin temperature changes at puncture sites and studied thermographic patterns related to induration or necrosis caused by extravasation. Outpatients undergoing chemotherapy using peripheral intravenous catheters were enrolled in this prospective observational study. We filmed and classified infrared thermography movies of puncture sites during infusion; ultrasonography was also utilized at puncture sites to observe the subcutaneous condition. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of thermographic patterns with induration or necrosis observed on the next chemotherapy day. Differences in patient characteristics, puncture sites, and infusions were analyzed by Mann-Whitney's U test and Fisher's exact test according to thermographic patterns. Eight patients developed induration among 74 observations in 62 patients. Among six thermographic patterns, a fan-shaped lower temperature area gradually spreading from the puncture site (fan at puncture site) was significantly associated with induration. Ultrasonography revealed that catheters of patients with fan at puncture site remained in the vein at the end of infusion, indicating that the infusion probably leaked from the puncture site. Patients with fan at puncture site had no significant differences in characteristics and infusion conditions compared with those with the other five thermographic patterns. We determined that fan at puncture site was related to induration caused by extravasation.

This study was designed to measure the discrepancies and study factors that may contribute to wire movement. Prospective data were collected on patients who underwent wire localization lumpectomy. Clip and hook location, breast size, density, and direction of wire placement were the main focus of the analysis. Wire movement was more likely with longer distance from skin to hook or clip, larger breast size (especially if ""fatty""), longer time between wire placement and surgery start time, and medial wire placement in larger breast. Age, body mass index, presence of mass, malignant diagnosis, tumor grade, and clip distance to the chest wall were not associated with wire movement. A longer distance from skin to hook correlated with larger specimen volume. Translation of the lesion location from a 2-dimensional mammogram into 3-dimensional breasts is sometimes discrepant because of movement of the localizing wire.

A 67-year-old lady with a chronic, non-healing ulcer in her leg had a squamous cell carcinoma excised, followed by radiotherapy. Despite multiple excisions, the ulcer continued to cause symptoms. Following an initial procedure in which fat was infiltrated around and under the ulcer, the patient underwent a wide local excision and split-thickness skin grafting. Histology demonstrated a post-radiation dermatitis ulcer with no evidence of malignancy. After a period of management with dressings showing a reduction in ulcer size, more fat was infiltrated around the lesion. Two months later, the ulcer had fully healed and has not recurred.

28447210,"Although treatment of melanoma with BRAF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors achieves a high response rate, a subset of melanoma patients with intrinsic and acquired resistance are insensitive to these therapeutics, so to improve melanoma therapy other target molecules need to be found. Here, we screened our chemical library to identify an anti-melanoma agent and examined its action mechanisms to show cell growth inhibition activity. We screened a chemical library against multiple skin cancer cell lines and conducted ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to investigate the mechanisms of CH5552074 activity. Suppression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression levels was determined in melanoma cells treated with CH5552074. Cell growth inhibition activity of CH5552074 was evaluated in MITF-dependent melanoma cell lines. We identified an anti-melanoma compound, CH5552074, which showed remarkable cell growth inhibition activity in melanoma cell lines. The IPA results suggested that CH5552074-sensitive cell lines had activated MITF. In further in vitro studies in the melanoma cell lines, a knockdown of MITF with siRNA resulted in cell growth inhibition, which showed that CH5552074 inhibited cell growth by reducing the expression level of MITF protein. These results suggest that CH5552074 can inhibit cell growth in melanoma cells by reducing the protein level of MITF. MITF inhibition by CH5552074 would be an attractive option for melanoma treatment.",skin_neoplasms
28445515,"Metastatic melanoma is still one of the most prevalent skin cancers, which upon progression has neither a prognostic marker nor a specific and lasting treatment. Proteomic analysis is a versatile approach with high throughput data and results that can be used for characterizing tissue samples. However, such analysis is hampered by the complexity of the disease, heterogeneity of patients, tumors, and samples themselves. With the long term aim of quest for better diagnostics biomarkers, as well as predictive and prognostic markers, we focused on relating high resolution proteomics data to careful histopathological evaluation of the tumor samples and patient survival information. Regional lymph node metastases obtained from ten patients with metastatic melanoma (stage III) were analyzed by histopathology and proteomics using mass spectrometry. Out of the ten patients, six had clinical follow-up data. The protein deep mining mass spectrometry data was related to the histopathology tumor tissue sections adjacent to the area used for deep-mining. Clinical follow-up data provided information on disease progression which could be linked to protein expression aiming to identify tissue-based specific protein markers for metastatic melanoma and prognostic factors for prediction of progression of stage III disease. In this feasibility study, several proteins were identified that positively correlated to tumor tissue content including IF6, ARF4, MUC18, UBC12, CSPG4, PCNA, PMEL and MAGD2. The study also identified MYC, HNF4A and TGFB1 as top upstream regulators correlating to tumor tissue content. Other proteins were inversely correlated to tumor tissue content, the most significant being; TENX, EHD2, ZA2G, AOC3, FETUA and THRB. A number of proteins were significantly related to clinical outcome, among these, HEXB, PKM and GPNMB stood out, as hallmarks of processes involved in progression from stage III to stage IV disease and poor survival. In this feasibility study, promising results show the feasibility of relating proteomics to histopathology and clinical outcome, and insight thus can be gained into the molecular processes driving the disease. The combined analysis of histological features including the sample cellular composition with protein expression of each metastasis enabled the identification of novel, differentially expressed proteins. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these putative biomarkers can be utilized in diagnostics and prognostic prediction of metastatic melanoma.",skin_neoplasms

The primary purpose of the authors' study was to evaluate the utilization of a fresh-tissue cadaver model (FTCM) as a method for the instruction of common dermatologic procedures. The authors' secondary aim was to assess students' perceived clinical skills and overall perception of the field of dermatology after the lab. Nineteen first- and second-year medical students were pre- and post-tested on their ability to perform punch and excisional biopsies on a fresh-tissue cadaver. Students were then surveyed on their experience. Assessment of the cognitive knowledge gain and technical skills revealed a statistically significant improvement in all categories (p < .001). An analysis of the survey demonstrated that 78.9% were more interested in selecting dermatology as a career and 63.2% of participants were more likely to refer their future patients to a Mohs surgeon. An FTCM is a viable method for the instruction and training of dermatologic procedures. In addition, the authors conclude that an FTCM provides realistic instruction for common dermatologic procedures and enhances medical students' early exposure and interest in the field of dermatology.",skin_neoplasms

However, the majority of current studies are biased or combine large databases introducing inherent flaws. Here, we present a prospective single surgeon experience comparing three ADM. All expander based breast reconstructions between 2014 and 2015 using ADM were included. Eighteen patients (32 breasts) underwent reconstruction using Flex Pliable, 15 patients (22 breasts) used Alloderm, and 14 patients (20 breasts) had Dermacell. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or comorbidities. All expanders were placed into a subpectoral position, and there were no direct to implant cases. Average intraoperative fill was comparable, (Flex: 225?cc, Alloderm: 180?cc, Dermacell: 130?cc). There were no differences in seroma, infection, or mastectomy skin flap necrosis rates.

The patient developed asymmetric, proximal muscle weakness and atrophy in all four limbs. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed albuminocytologic dissociation. MRI revealed contrast enhancement of the lumbosacral roots. Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated widespread fibrillation potentials in all four limbs, suggesting a generalized motor polyradiculopathy. Despite pembrolizumab discontinuation and treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, limb weakness worsened. Electrodiagnostic studies were repeated, and showed marked and diffuse axonal motor damage. Seven weeks after clinical onset the patient was treated with plasma exchanges.

ALMs have a worse prognosis than other melanoma subtypes; this has been attributed to aggressive biological behaviour, more advanced stage at presentation and possible disparities in access to health care. To examine, using comprehensive patient data and long-term follow-up information in a well-characterized cohort, how patient, tumour and clinical management variables impact overall and melanoma-specific survival. We characterized a consecutive cohort of 123 ALMs diagnosed from 1987 to 2013 and analysed predictors of overall and melanoma-specific survival for their association with survival. Univariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression models showed that increased Breslow depth, presence of ulceration, receipt of radiation, chemo- and vaccine therapy were associated with worse melanoma-specific survival. Notably, nonwhite race/ethnicity was not associated with worse overall or melanoma-specific survival. Multivariate modelling adjusting for patient, tumour and management variables revealed Breslow depth > 2 mm and disease extent as significantly associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. Melanoma-specific mortality among patients with ALM is associated with increased tumour thickness and more advanced stage at presentation, but not with race/ethnicity. Advanced tumour features at presentation and access to care may account for less favourable survival outcomes reported among nonwhite patients.",skin_neoplasms

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) is a co-inhibitory receptor primarily expressed by T-cells. Tumor cells can escape anticancer immune responses by triggering the PD1 pathway. Moreover, PD1 receptor engagement on cancer cells may trigger tumor-intrinsic growth signals. This study aimed to evaluate the potential clinical relevance of PD1 expression by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells in the AEG.

28425055,"Joint salvage surgery for patients with juxtaarticular osteosarcoma remains challenging, especially when the tumor invades the epiphysis. Because patients are surviving longer with current chemotherapy regimens, it is advantageous to retain native joints if possible, especially in young patients. However, the results using joint-preserving tumor resections in this context have not been well characterized. (1) What are the functional outcomes after limb salvage surgery at a minimum of 3 years? (2) What are the oncologic outcomes? (3) Is joint salvage surgery for epiphyseal tumors associated with an increased risk of local recurrence compared with metaphyseal tumors not invading the epiphysis? (4) What are the complications associated with joint salvage surgery? Between 2004 and 2013, we treated 117 patients with juxtaarticular osteosarcoma; of those, 43 (38%) were treated with joint salvage surgery, and 41 (95%) of the 43 patients are included in our study. The other two (5%) were lost to followup before 3 years (mean, 4.4 years; range, 3-11 years,). During the period in question, we generally performed joint salvage surgery in these patients when they had a favorable response to chemotherapy, did not have a pathologic fracture or extrusion of the tumor into the joint, and did not have a whole-epiphyseal osteolytic lesion, a large mass, or obvious neurovascular involvement. This report is a followup of an earlier study; the current study includes an additional nine patients, and additional followup of a mean of 19 months for the patients included in the earlier report. We ascertained overall survival and survival free from local recurrence which was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, functional status of the limb which was evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS)-93 scoring system, and recorded reconstructive complications including infection, fracture, skin necrosis, and nonunion. We compared oncologic and functional outcomes between patients with (n = 28) and without tumor extension to epiphysis (n =13). We also compared oncologic and functional outcomes among patients with different adjuvant treatments including microwave ablation (n = 11), cryoablation (n = 12), and navigation-assisted osteotomy (n = 5). Complications were tallied using records from our institutional database. The overall Kaplan-Mayer survival rate was 82% (95% CI, 104-128 months) at 5 years. The overall Kaplan-Meier survivorship from local recurrence was 91% at 5 years (95% CI, 115-133 months). Three patients had a local recurrence, but none had local recurrence in or close to the remaining epiphysis. The MSTS scores ranged from 22 to 30 points, with a median of 28. There were no differences in survival rate, local recurrence, or MSTS scores between patients with a tumor that did not invade the epiphysis and those in whom the tumor did invade the epiphysis. There were differences in MSTS scores among patients with epiphyseal tumor extension in which different adjuvant techniques, including microwave ablation, cryoablation, and navigation-assisted osteotomy, were used. Additional surgical procedures were recorded for 10 patients (24%). Osteonecrosis of the residual epiphysis was detected 13 patients (31%). Our findings suggest it is possible to salvage joints in selected patients with juxtaarticular osteosarcoma around the knee. The patients who have a favorable response to chemotherapy are the best candidates for this approach. Future studies might explore the role of adjuvant techniques of microwave ablation and cryoablation, particularly when the tumor invades the epiphysis, and whether resections can be facilitated with navigation.

The objective of the present study was to review the experience of 8 Italian pediatric and dermatologic centers regarding propranolol treatment for IH started before 5?weeks or after 5?months of age. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients followed up for IH, on propranolol treatment started before 5?weeks or after 5?months of age, and collected information on sociodemographic data, treatment indications, IH involution, IH relapse, and treatment side effects. A total of 343 patients were enrolled; 15 were started on propranolol before 5?weeks (group 1), 328 were started after 5?months of age (group 2). The most frequent indications were permanent aesthetical disfigurement (91.8%) and function threatening complications (42.6%). In most cases, the treatment was effective. The involution was partial in 67.7% of patients. In 11.8% of cases a relapse was observed. No relapse was observed in group 1. Treatment complications were reported in 15.8% of children, most frequently sleep disorders (6.6%), followed by irritability (5.1%) and diarrhea (2.2%). Only a case of mild constipation was observed in group 1. The safety and effectiveness profile of propranolol in infants younger than 5?weeks or older than 5?months may be acceptable.

The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer types. In this study, we compare TMB measured by a targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome. We then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types. We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from whole exome sequencing and model that below 0.5?Mb the variance in measurement increases significantly. We find that a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite instability status. We find that TMB increases significantly with age, showing a 2.4-fold difference between age 10 and age 90?years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level. We identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the gene PMS2, which occur in 10% of skin cancers and are highly associated with increased TMB. These results show that a CGP assay targeting ~1.1?Mb of coding genome can accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we identify novel, recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.",skin_neoplasms

The development of BRAF kinase inhibitors as targeted treatments for patients with BRAF-mutant tumours contributed profoundly to an improved overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Despite these promising results, the emergence of rapid resistance to targeted therapy remains a serious clinical issue. To investigate the impact of BRAF inhibitors on miRNomes and transcriptomes, we used in vitro melanoma models consisting of BRAF inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant cell lines generated in our laboratory. Subsequently, microarray analyses were performed followed by RT-qPCR validations. Regarding miRNome and transcriptome changes, the long-term effects of BRAF inhibition differed in a cell line-specific manner with the two different BRAF inhibitors inducing comparable responses in three melanoma cell lines. Despite this heterogeneity, several miRNAs (e.g. miR-92a-1-5p, miR-708-5p) and genes (e.g. DOK5, PCSK2) were distinctly differentially expressed in drug-resistant versus -sensitive cell lines. Analyses of coexpressed miRNAs, as well as inversely correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs, revealed a low MITF/AXL ratio in two drug-resistant cell lines that might be regulated by miRNAs. Several genes and miRNAs were differentially regulated in the drug-resistant and -sensitive cell lines and might be considered as prognostic and/or diagnostic resistance biomarkers in melanoma drug resistance. Thus far, only little information is available on the significance and role of miRNAs with respect to kinase inhibitor treatments and emergence of drug resistance.

A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address parameter uncertainty. The mean cost of the intervention was A$5,298 compared with A$4,684 for usual care, whereas mean QALYs were 7.58 for the intervention group and 7.77 for the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would cost A$1,059 per life-year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective up to A$50,000 per QALY gained was 43.9%. The model was stable to most data estimates; nevertheless, it relies on the specificity of clinical diagnosis of skin cancers and is subject to limited health utility data for people with skin lesions. Although the intervention improved skin checking behaviors and encouraged men to seek medical advice about suspicious lesions, the overall costs and effects from also detecting more squamous and basal cell carcinomas and benign lesions outweighed the positive health gains from detecting more thin melanomas.",skin_neoplasms

Seventeen cases of MCC previously stained with CD56 were also examined. All BCCs showed patchy expression of CD56 except for 2 cases, which showed staining of greater than 70% of tumor. CK5/6 was diffusely positive in all cases of BCC. Fifteen of 17 MCCs were diffusely positive for CD56. The difference in the pattern of CD56 expression between MCC and BCC (diffuse vs patchy, respectively) was statistically significant (P < .05). BCC typically shows patchy CD56 expression and diffuse CK5/6 positivity. These 2 markers can be used to distinguish between BCC and MCC in challenging cases.",skin_neoplasms

Adaptive and innate immunity play a key role controlling tumor growth and are influenced by different immunosuppressive agents. We hypothesized that functional impairment of tumor-specific T cell responses due to calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) could contribute to SCC development, whereas conversion to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-i) could recover this protective immune response. Peripheral tumor-specific T cell responses against main SCC-derived antigens using the IFN-?? enzyme-linked immunospot assay and intratumor (IT) and circulating immune phenotypes (CD4 + T, CD8 + T, CD20 + B, CD56 + NK, FOXP3 + regulatory T [Treg] cells) were explored in a cross-sectional analysis in 59 kidney transplant patients with SCC on CNI (KT-CNI-SCC) or mTOR-i (KT-mTORi-SCC), 25 nontransplants developing SCC (NoKT-SCC) and 6 healthy controls. Moreover, 25 KT-CNI-SCC were switched to mTOR-i and evaluated after 12 months. Kidney transplant patients showed lower IT infiltrates and tumor-specific T cell responses than NoKT-SCC, and intratumoral and circulating FOXP3 + Treg cells were higher in KT-mTORi-SCC (P < 0.05).

For this retrospective data analysis all clinical and dermoscopic digital images of primary malignant melanomas between 2008 and 2013 documented at the Department of Dermatology Graz were included, using the internal image data-base. 550 patients with 559 melanomas were included. While clinical or dermoscopic analysis considered ulceration to be present in 120 (21.5%) and 117 (20.9%) of all lesions, respectively, histopathology reported ulceration in only 96 cases (17.2%). The presence of milky-red areas, shiny-white streaks, a blue-white veil and blue-grey areas in dermoscopy is highly correlated with histological ulceration and a mitotic rate > 1/mm2. The dermoscopic patterns shiny-white streaks, milky-red areas and blue-white veil were also significantly associated with development of distant metastases. Our study proves a significant correlation between the dermoscopic patterns ""blue white veil"", ""milky-red areas""and ""shiny-white streaks""and the histological findings ""ulceration""and ""mitotic rate > 1/mm2"". Furthermore these dermoscopic patterns are highly related to distant metastases. Thus, dermoscopy renders earlier prognostic statements possible.",skin_neoplasms

We conducted a retrospective outcomes analysis of 50 patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma treated by curative intent identified from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Registry (from 1958 to 2014). Median survival was 26 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.6-34.6) and median follow-up 29 months. For the scalp and face, respectively, the 5-year locoregional control rate was 9% and 53% (p = .04); the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 5% and 27% (p = .017); and the overall survival (OS) rate was 9% and 26% (p = .017). Scalp lesions were larger, more likely to be multifocal, and presented more rapidly once noticed. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, scalp location was independently prognostic for mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; 95% CI, 1.03-4.28; p = .04). Scalp angiosarcoma has worse survival than angiosarcoma of the face. Scalp angiosarcoma tends to be larger at presentation, which may be because it is not noticed until more advanced. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 1205-1211, 2017.",skin_neoplasms

Retrospective population-based analysis. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry from 2000 to 2013, we extracted 627 cases of HNSGA. Data were analyzed for incidence trends, demographic and clinicopathologic traits, and predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS). The majority HNSGA cases were white, male, and 60 to 79 years old. The incidence was 0.036 per 100,000 people. Tumors most often presented as localized disease and histological grade II/III. The skin of the face was the most common primary site (43.4%), followed by the scalp and neck (31.6%). Overall 5-, 10-, and 20-year DSS were 94.6%, 89.6%, and 79.8%, respectively. Ethnicity did not affect survival, whereas a younger age at diagnosis and female sex conferred an advantage at 10 years (P = 0.0386) and 5 years (P = 0.0191), respectively. The origin of the HNSGA (apocrine vs. eccrine) did not affect outcomes. Regional and distant disease predicted worse DSS at 5, 10, and 20 years (P = 0.0026, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Compared to grade I/II disease, grade III/IV dramatically worsened 5-, 10-, and 20-year DSS (P = 0.0035, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0011, respectively). Scalp and neck HNSGA exhibited the poorest 20-year DSS compared to other primary sites (P = 0.0024). We present the largest cohort of HNSGA.

Herein, we describe the first reported case of GSS associated with metastatic testicular seminoma. A 28-year-old male patient presented with circumscribed erythematous loose skin masses, especially in the body folds and which had been relapsing for 4years. Skin biopsy showed a loss of elastic fibers and an atypical granulomatous T-cell infiltrate with epidermotropism, enabling a diagnosis of GSS to be made. A biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy showed testicular seminoma metastasis. Patients suffering from GSS have a statistically higher risk of developing a second primary cancer, especially Hodgkin's lymphoma. The association found between GSS and a lymphoproliferative malignancy requires long-term follow-up and determines the patient's prognosis. It is not possible to prove a formal link between GSS and testicular seminoma. However, this case illustrates the value of screening for a second cancer, particularly where extra-cutaneous lesions appear during GSS treatment.

The limited available data on Mohs micrographic surgery do not demonstrate its use as a standard procedure. A previous study in a limited series of patients has shown that wide surgical excision of the nail unit was associated with a low rate of recurrence. To confirm the efficiency of wide surgical excision of the nail unit with full-thickness skin graft reconstruction on a series of patients with SUSCC with an extended follow-up and to evaluate short- and long-term postoperative morbidity and patient satisfaction. A consecutive series of 55 patients with biopsy-proven SUSCC without bone invasion treated by wide surgical excision of the nail unit followed by full-thickness skin graft reconstruction from January 1, 2000, to August 31, 2012 were included. After a minimum follow-up of 5 years, the recurrences were collected from the referring physicians. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2016. Demographic data, pathologic characteristics of tumors, postoperative follow-up, and recurrences were collected from medical records. Patients' satisfaction with surgery, quality of life, and delayed postoperative morbidity (functional outcome and sensory disorders) were assessed from a questionnaire mailed to patients and physicians. Among the 55 patients (23 women and 32 men; mean age, 64 years), the mean follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 5.0-11.2 years), with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Fifty-two questionnaires (95%) were returned. Two recurrences were observed. Minor early postoperative complications, such as graft infection and delayed wound healing, were seen in 6 patients; 8 patients experienced severe pain. Late postoperative complications included hypersensitivity to mechanical shocks (39 of 51 patients [76%]), mildly increased sensitivity to cold (38 of 51 patients [75%]), loss of fine touch sensation (17 of 35 patients [49%]), and epidermal inclusion cysts (9 of 51 patients [18%]).

Identifying disease patterns associated with PDAC risk may enable a better characterization of high-risk patients. Multimorbidity patterns (MPs) were assessed from 17 self-reported conditions using hierarchical clustering, principal component, and factor analyses in 1705 PDAC cases and 1084 controls from a European population. Their association with PDAC was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models. Time since diagnosis of morbidities to PDAC diagnosis/recruitment was stratified into recent (<3 years) and long term (??3 years). The MPs and PDAC genetic networks were explored with DisGeNET bioinformatics-tool which focuses on gene-diseases associations available in curated databases. Three MPs were observed: gastric (heartburn, acid regurgitation, Helicobacter pylori infection, and ulcer), metabolic syndrome (obesity, type-2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension), and atopic (nasal allergies, skin allergies, and asthma). Strong associations with PDAC were observed for ??2 recently diagnosed gastric conditions [odds ratio (OR), 6.13; 95% confidence interval CI 3.01-12.5)] and for ??3 recently diagnosed metabolic syndrome conditions (OR, 1.61; 95% CI 1.11-2.35).

We assessed associations of pigmentary traits and UV exposure with personal history of benign thyroid diseases using logistic regression modeling. All statistical tests were two sided. In models adjusted for age and thyroid cancer risk factors, number of nevi was positively associated with thyroid cancer risk (""very many"" vs. ""none"": hazards ratio [HR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0, 2.8; Ptrend = 0.01), independently of residential UV exposure or iodine intake.

A retrospective review of 49 consecutive patients who underwent immediate two-stage expander-implant breast reconstruction and received post-mastectomy XRT was conducted. Full deflation of the expanders was performed in the deflation group (20 patients), while the expanders remained inflated in the inflation group at the time of XRT (29 patients). XRT-related complications of each stage of reconstructions were compared between the two groups, and multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for XRT-related complications. Overall XRT-related complications (65.0 vs. 6.9%, p?<?0.001) and reconstruction failures (35.0 vs. 6.9%, p?=?0.022) of the first-stage reconstructions were significantly higher in the deflation group.

In this study, we studied the RNA expression profiles of 26 MCC tumors, with a goal to identify prospective molecular targets that could improve the treatment strategies of MCC. RNA expression of 50 cancer-related genes in 26 MCC tumors was analyzed by targeted amplicon based next-generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent technology and the expression compared with that of normal, non-cancerous skin samples. Sequencing data were processed using Torrent Suite?? Software. Expression profiles of MCV-negative and MCV-positive tumors were compared. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to study ALK rearrangements and immunohistochemistry to study ALK expression in tumor tissue. ALK, CDKN2A, EZH2 and ERBB4 were overexpressed, and EGFR, ERBB2, PDGFRA and FGFR1 were underexpressed in MCC tumors compared to normal skin.

28356127,"Confluent squamous cell carcinoma in situ, or Bowen's disease, involving the hand, digit, and nail bed is rare and represents a significant therapeutic challenge. Surgical excision is recommended as first-line treatment but in cases of extensive disease can lead to unacceptable functional morbidity or cosmetic outcomes. Radiation therapy has been shown to be equally efficacious to surgery in the treatment of carcinoma in situ but its use has historically been limited due to concerns regarding toxicity. In this case report we present a novel therapeutic technique that may enable radiotherapy to be employed as a definitive treatment option in these challenging cases. A 75-year-old white man with a previous history of carcinoma in situ of his right hand previously treated with 5-fluorouracil presented with recurrent biopsy-proven confluent squamous cell carcinoma in situ of multiple surfaces of his right hand and digits with involvement of nail beds. To avoid extensive resection and possible amputation he was offered definitive external beam radiation therapy utilizing a water bath as a tissue-equivalent bolus material. This protocol enabled improved dose homogeneity to the target volume while minimizing acute toxicity. He experienced complete clinical resolution of the disease with only minimal acute edema and hyperpigmentation. Twenty months following treatment completion he remains disease-free with normal function and excellent cosmesis. Therapeutic radiation utilizing water as a tissue-equivalent bolus in this complicated case enabled definitive treatment of disease without compromising functional or cosmetic outcomes. Radiotherapy may therefore be an alternative and under-utilized approach to surgical excision in difficult-to-treat cases of carcinoma in situ.",skin_neoplasms

Our goal was to conduct a candidate gene study in HNSCC patients receiving RT or chemoRT. 122 non-resectable HNSCC patients undergoing RT (N=38) or chemoRT (N=84) between 1992 and 2006 were retrospectively analyzed. ERCC1 Lys259Thr (rs735482), ERCC2 Lys751Gln (rs13181), ERCC5 His46His C>T (rs1047768), XRCC1 Arg399Gln (rs25487), TP53 Arg72Pro (rs1042522) and MDM2 309T>G (rs2279744) were analyzed on tumor DNA. SNP profile was considered to assess RT-related toxicity. All 120 evaluable patients experienced RT-related toxicity at any time. Among them, 83% had G3-4 acute side-effects during RT, mainly dysphagia, mucositis, epithelitis and/or xerostomia (DMEX). 28/105 patients (27%) had early G3-4 toxicity up to 3months after the end of RT. 29/96 patients (30%) had G3-4 late toxicity thereafter. The presence of G allele of MDM2 or Thr allele of ERCC1 was associated with a significantly higher risk of acute and/or early DMEX toxicity. The MDM2 309GG genotype was linked to a higher risk of acute G3-4 dermatitis. The ERCC5 TT genotype was associated with more frequent G3-4 late cervical skin fibrosis or xerostomia. Pro allele of TP53 72 was associated with a higher risk of G3-4 osteoradionecrosis.

To determine if dietary supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium reduces the risk of cancer among older women. A 4-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, population-based randomized clinical trial in 31 rural counties (June 24, 2009, to August 26, 2015-the final date of follow-up). A total of 2303 healthy postmenopausal women 55 years or older were randomized, 1156 to the treatment group and 1147 to the placebo group. Duration of treatment was 4 years. The treatment group (vitamin D3?+?calcium group) received 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg/d of calcium; the placebo group received identical placebos. The primary outcome was the incidence of all-type cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and proportional hazards modeling. Among 2303 randomized women (mean age, 65.2 years [SD, 7.0]; mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 32.8 ng/mL [SD, 10.5]), 2064 (90%) completed the study. At year 1, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 43.9 ng/mL in the vitamin D3?+?calcium group and 31.6 ng/mL in the placebo group. A new diagnosis of cancer was confirmed in 109 participants, 45 (3.89%) in the vitamin D3?+?calcium group and 64 (5.58%) in the placebo group (difference, 1.69% [95% CI, -0.06% to 3.46%]; P?=?.06). Kaplan-Meier incidence over 4 years was 0.042 (95% CI, 0.032 to 0.056) in the vitamin D3?+?calcium group and 0.060 (95% CI, 0.048 to 0.076) in the placebo group; P?=?.06. In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, the hazard ratio was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.02). Adverse events potentially related to the study included renal calculi (16 participants in the vitamin D3?+?calcium group and 10 in the placebo group), and elevated serum calcium levels (6 in the vitamin D3?+?calcium group and 2 in the placebo group). Among healthy postmenopausal older women with a mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 32.8 ng/mL, supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium compared with placebo did not result in a significantly lower risk of all-type cancer at 4 years.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether using a photograph of the histopathological slide as the Mohs map improves mapping accuracy. Single-blinded pilot study. Five dermatology residents at one academic institution mapped 11 cases of basal cell carcinoma using both traditional hand-drawn maps and color photographic maps. Residents' marked maps were assessed for global diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared with the Mohs map verified by the attending surgeon on the day of surgery. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were higher using the photographic Mohs maps compared with using the traditional hand-drawn maps (58.2% vs 29.1%, 84.5% vs 76.4%, and 87.1% vs 70.8%, respectively). These results were statistically significant for accuracy and specificity, but not for sensitivity. Using histopathological photographs as the Mohs map significantly improved accuracy and specificity within a small group of residents with limited Mohs experience.

Employing hypofractionation and simultaneous integrated boost to lumpectomy cavity with conformal technique is not the current practice in this region. Hence the study was performed to see whether accelerated hypofractionation and simultaneous boost can be combined using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in treating early breast cancer (EBC) patients. Female patients with EBC treated by whole breast radiation and boost were treated simultaneously to a dose of 40.5Gy and 48Gy in fifteen fractions over three weeks to entire breast and tumor cavity respectively with VMAT. Dosimetry including target coverage, OAR (organ at risk) sparing and acute radiation toxicity were evaluated. BOOST were 127.56% and 110.67% respectively. Ipsilateral lung mean dose and V20 were 13.92Gy and 21.53% respectively. V40 and V25 of heart were 0.17% and 2.25% respectively. All patients are disease free after a median follow up of two years. Most acute toxicities were Grade1. Only two patients out of ten developed Grade 2 skin reaction during radiation. Early cosmesis using Harvard cosmesis scale is good to excellent. Accelerated hypofractionated RT using SIB-VMAT is a clinically feasible technique with acceptable initial result. Initial results are encouraging.

Previous studies with SOX10 have shown positive immunohistochemical expression in cutaneous eccrine glands and negative expression in eccrine ducts, apocrine glands and hair follicles. Thus, we hypothesized that some sweat gland tumors of presumed eccrine origin would be positive for SOX10, whereas apocrine-derived sweat gland tumors would not. A mouse monoclonal anti-SOX10 (clone BC34: Biocare Medical; Concord, California) immunohistochemical antibody was performed on various sweat gland tumors and basal cell carcinoma.

There was mixed staining of hidradenomas (6/15). SOX10 immunohistochemistry may be of utility in distinguishing some of the varying adnexal tumors from each other, and from basal cell carcinoma (BCC), but given the staining of both apocrine and eccrine tumors, does not seem to provide information as to their origins as either eccrine or apocrine tumors.",skin_neoplasms

28342106,"Computerized prescreening of suspicious moles and lesions for malignancy is of great importance for assessing the need and the priority of the removal surgery. Detection can be done by images captured by standard cameras, which are more preferable due to low cost and availability. One important step in computerized evaluation is accurate detection of lesion's region, i.e., segmentation of an image into two regions as lesion and normal skin. In this paper, a new method based on deep neural networks is proposed for accurate extraction of a lesion region. The input image is preprocessed, and then, its patches are fed to a convolutional neural network. Local texture and global structure of the patches are processed in order to assign pixels to lesion or normal classes. A method for effective selection of training patches is proposed for more accurate detection of a lesion's border. Our results indicate that the proposed method could reach the accuracy of 98.7% and the sensitivity of 95.2% in segmentation of lesion regions over the dataset of clinical images. The experimental results of qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms exist in the literature.",skin_neoplasms

Funding trends were compared along the cancer control continuum, with respect to investigator demographics and use of theory, technology, policy, and changes to environmental surroundings (built environment). A total of 112 submitted applications met inclusion criteria; of these, 40 (35.7%) were funded, and 31 of the 40 were interventions. Comparing the 40 funded grants with the 72 unfunded grants, the overall success rates did not differ significantly between male (33.3%) and female (37.3%) investigators, nor did the frequency of R01 awards (36.7% and 28.1%, respectively). Among intervention awards, most (24 of 31) addressed prevention. Fewer awards targeted detection alone or in conjunction with prevention (3) or cancer survivorship (4), and no grant addressed emotional sequelae or adherence behavior related to diagnosis or treatment. Fewer than half of funded grants aimed for clinically related targets (eg, sunburn reduction). Use of theory and technology occurred in more than 75% of grants. However, the full capability of proposed technology was infrequently used, and rarely did constructs of the proposed behavior change theory clearly and comprehensively drive the intervention approach. Policy or environmental manipulation was present in all dissemination grants but was rarely used elsewhere, and 19.4% included policy implementation and 25.8% proposed changes in built environment. Grant success rate in skin cancer-related behavioral science compares favorably to the overall NIH grant success rate (approximately 18%), and the success rate of male and female investigators was not statistically different.

Among 22 patients we observed 6 repeatable patterns of distribution of GCMN, which we termed the ""6B"": bolero (involving the upper aspect of the back, including the neck), back (on the back, without involvement of the buttocks or shoulders), bathing trunk (involving the genital region and buttocks), breast/belly (isolated to the chest or abdomen without involvement of bolero or bathing trunk distributions), body extremity (isolated to extremity), and body (both bolero and bathing trunk involvement). Our literature search found 113 cases of GCMN, which we were able to classify into 1 of the 6B patterns with an overall kappa of 0.89. Some patterns occur infrequently with a dearth of images available for analysis. The anatomic distribution of GCMN occurs in 6 recognizable and repeatable patterns.",skin_neoplasms
28324746,"Giant-cell tumours of bone (GCTB) are RANK/RANK-ligand (RANKL) positive, aggressive and progressive osteolytic tumours. Denosumab, a RANKL inhibitor, was FDA-approved for adults and skeletally mature adolescents with unresectable GCTB or when surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. Data on long-term toxicity and activity of denosumab monthly 'GCTB-schedule' (120?mg per 12/year, 1440?mg total dose/year) are lacking. Patients with GCTB receiving denosumab, 120?mg on days 1, 8, 15, 29?and every 4 weeks thereafter, from 2006 to 2015 treated in two centres were included. Long-term toxicity was evaluated. Ninety-seven patients were identified. 43 patients underwent resection of the tumour?with a median time on denosumab treatment of 12 months (range 6-45 months). Fifty-four patients had unresectable GCTB's (male/female 23/31, median age 35 years [range: 13-76 years], 26% presented with lung metastases, 31% had primary tumor located to the spine, 63% were?relapsed after previous surgery)?with a median time on denosumab of 54 months (9-115?months). In the unresectable GCTB group, tumour control and clinical benefits were observed in all patients undergoing denosumab, whereas 40% of patients discontinuing denosumab had tumour progression after a median of 8 months (range 7-15 months). Overall, six (6%) patients developed osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ): 1/43 (2%) in the resectable group, 5/54 (9%) in the unresectable group, with a 5-year ONJ-free survival of 92% (95% CI 84-100). Only patients with prolonged treatment experienced mild peripheral neuropathy (6/54, 11%), skin rash (5/54, 9%), hypophosphataemia (2/54, 4%) and atypical femoral fracture (2/54, 4%). Prolonged treatment with denosumab has sustained activity in GCTB, with a mild toxicity profile. The dose-dependent toxicity observed recommends a careful and strict monitoring of patients who need prolonged treatment. Decreased dose-intensity schedules should be further explored in unresectable GCTB.",skin_neoplasms

A single-center, prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I/II/IIIA melanoma of the limbs, trunk, or neck who had undergone wide excision and SNB, but not complete regional node dissection, was undertaken. Limb volume was measured using perometry, with lymphedema defined as a ??10% volume increase in the ipsilateral limb compared with the contralateral limb. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire measured QoL. Associations between patient and treatment characteristics were assessed using linear regression. Among 694 patients (median time from SNB of 37 months), 14 (2%) had objectively measured lymphedema (i.e. an increase in limb volume of ??10%). Of 687 stage I/II patients with complete QoL data, the mean weighted QoL was 0.745 (standard deviation 0.04) on a 0-1 scale (i.e. death to full health).

This review is aimed at summarizing the available literature to reduce the confusion surrounding this rare malignancy, and aid the surgeon in choosing further diagnostic or therapeutic measures. We conducted a search of Medline, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus and the Cochrane Library for all full text articles published in English that reported on a malignant melanoma arising from, in association with, or resembling a blue nevus. We identified 91 cases that fit the criteria above. The mean age at diagnosis was 45 years, with a slight male predominance (males: 48; females: 43). Metastatic cases were reported in 55% (n = 50), of which 16 were metastatic at the time of diagnosis, 16 developed metastases within the first year and 18 within 5 years of initial diagnosis. The mean Breslow thickness was 6.8 mm at the time of diagnosis (n = 39). The histological criteria for diagnosing this malignancy are very poorly defined, and may contribute to the substantial confusion surrounding the terminology. There is no consensus on which prognostic indicators predictive of outcome in 'conventional' malignant melanoma are applicable to blue nevus-like melanoma/blue nevus-associated melanoma. However, two larger case series have demonstrated a significant association between Breslow thickness (or largest tumour dimension when non-epidermal) and recurrence-free survival, as well as rate of local recurrence, but larger studies are needed to confirm this.",skin_neoplasms

The efficacy and toxicity profiles of checkpoint inhibitors in this cohort of patients are not well described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a renal transplant patient with stage IV melanoma treated with a programmed cell death protein 1 checkpoint inhibitor that led to both treatment failure and renal graft rejection. We present a case of a 58-year-old white man with a long-standing cadaveric renal transplant who was diagnosed with a B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase wild-type metastatic melanoma. He was treated with first-line pembrolizumab but experienced subsequent graft failure and rapid disease progression. This case highlights the risks associated with the administration of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with a renal transplant and on immunosuppressive therapy. More specifically, it adds to the literature indicating that, compared with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab, anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agents are more likely to lead to renal graft failure. Additionally, these novel immunotherapeutics may be ineffective in transplant patients; therefore, clinicians should be very aware of those risks and carefully consider selection of agents and full disclosure of the risks to their patients.",skin_neoplasms

Tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry refers to the formation of tumor cell-lined vessels that contribute to tumor neovascularization. The aim of the present work was to study angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors of the eye and the periocular region. Histological sections from 118 patients were studied. Eighty-eight of the patients had nevi while the remaining 30 had malignant melanomas. Microvascular density was assessed by using antibodies against the endothelial cell markers CD31 and CD34. Vascular-like channels between neoplastic cells, that were not lined by endothelial cells and thus were negative for CD31 and CD34, represented areas of vasculogenic mimicry. Angiogenesis was more pronounced in melanomas compared to melanocytic nevi and was increased in melanomas with high mitotic index and/or epithelioid cell preponderance compared to melanomas with low mitotic index and/or spindle cell predominance. Vasculogenic mimicry was observed in many melanomas, while it was evident in the minority of benign nevi as well.

It is one of the most common surgical problems. Rarely, chronic inflammation and recurrent disease leads to malignant transformation, most commonly to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We describe an extremely unusual case of SCC developing in a 60-year-old patient with a chronic pilonidal sinus complicated by an anal fistula. After wide surgical excision of the pilonidal sinus and fistulas and because of the poor healing process 6?months later, colonoscopy and a percutaneous fistulography were performed, revealing an anal canal-pilonidal fistula. Patient was treated with a more radical surgical resection with a prophylactic loop colostomy, but healing was not accelerated. Multiple biopsies were then taken from the surgical site at the time, which revealed the development of SCC. CT and MRI imaging techniques revealed SCC partial invasion of the coccyx and sacrum. As a result, aggressive surgical approach was decided. Histological examination revealed moderately to poorly differentiated SCC, and the patient was treated with adjuvant radiation therapy postoperatively. Nine months later, recurrence was found in the sacrum and para-aorta lymph nodes and the patient died shortly after. We discuss the clinical features, pathogenesis, treatment options, and prognosis of this rare malignant transformation. The development of SCC in chronic pilonidal disease is a rare but serious complication. Symptoms are usually attributed to the sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease (SPD), and diagnosis is often made late by histological examination of biopsies. Malignant transformation should be suspected in chronic SPD with recurrent episodes of inflammation, repeated purulent discharge, poor healing, and chronic complex fistulas.",skin_neoplasms

Systematic literature review (SLR) of observational studies comparing any DMARD with another intervention for the management of patients with RA. All safety outcomes were included. A comparator group was required for the study to be included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Hayden's tool. Twenty-six observational studies addressing diverse safety outcomes of therapy with bDMARDs met eligibility criteria (15 on serious infections, 4 on malignancies). Substantial heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Together with the evidence from the 2013 SLR, based on 15 studies, 7 at low risk of bias, patients on bDMARDs compared with patients on conventional sDMARDs had a higher risk of serious infections (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.1 to 1.8)-without differences across bDMARDs-a higher risk of tuberculosis (aHR 2.7 to 12.5), but no increased risk of infection by herpes zoster. Patients on bDMARDs did not have an increased risk of malignancies in general, lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer, but the risk of melanoma may be slightly increased (aHR 1.5).

POSP was assessed using resting numeric rating scale (NRS) scores measured for 96?h after surgery, which were analyzed using a linear mixed model. The slopes of the predicted NRS values from the linear mixed model were significantly different between the groups. Compared with the control group, the combined therapy group had lower predicted NRS scores for the first 72?h, but higher predicted scores between 72 and 96?h. Moreover, the mean NRS scores over the first 48?h postoperation were significantly lower in the combined therapy group than in the control group; the scores were similar in both groups during the remaining period. With the exception of a higher body mass index in the CWIS group, the other variables, such as the dosage and usage time of fentanyl citrate, use of additional painkillers, and side effects, including wound complications, did not differ between groups.

Pooled additional detection rate (ADR), diagnostic accuracy, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using STATA and Meta-Disc analysis. Eight published studies were included in the analysis, involving 1141 skin lesions, which reported a per-lesion analysis of dermoscopy and RCM. Within the same patient group and at the per-lesion level, RCM significantly increased the detection rate of malignant skin tumours by 7.7% (95% CI 0.01-0.14). The pooled sensitivity of dermoscopy was similar to RCM [88.1% (95% CI 0.85-0.91) vs. 93.5% (95% CI 0.91-0.96)]. The specificity of dermoscopy was significantly lower than that of RCM [52.9% (95% CI 0.49-0.57) vs. 80.3% (95% CI 0.77-0.83)].

28288569,"The inhibition of Delta-like 4 (Dll4)/Notch signaling has been shown to result in excessive, nonfunctional vessel proliferation and significant tumor growth suppression. However, safety concerns emerged with the identification of side effects resulting from chronic Dll4/Notch blockade. Alternatively, we explored the endothelial Dll4 overexpression using different mouse tumor models. We used a transgenic mouse model of endothelial-specific Dll4 overexpression, previously produced. Growth kinetics and vascular histopathology of several types of solid tumors was evaluated, namely Lewis Lung Carcinoma xenografts, chemically-induced skin papillomas and RIP1-Tag2 insulinomas. We found that increased Dll4/Notch signaling reduces tumor growth by reducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial proliferation, tumor vessel density and overall tumor blood supply. In addition, Dll4 overexpression consistently improved tumor vascular maturation and functionality, as indicated by increased vessel calibers, enhanced mural cell recruitment and increased network perfusion. Importantly, the tumor vessel normalization is not more effective than restricted vessel proliferation, but was found to prevent metastasis formation and allow for increased delivery to the tumor of concomitant chemotherapy, improving its efficacy. By reducing endothelial sensitivity to VEGF, these results imply that Dll4/Notch stimulation in tumor microenvironment could be beneficial to solid cancer patient treatment by reducing primary tumor size, improving tumor drug delivery and reducing metastization. Endothelial specific Dll4 overexpression thus appears as a promising anti-angiogenic modality that might improve cancer control.",skin_neoplasms

We analysed 54 potentially functional, common, inherited EGFR pathway variants in 815 patients with aCRC treated with oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy plus cetuximab. Primary endpoints were response and skin rash (SR). We had >85%?power to detect ORs=1.6 for variants with minor allele frequencies >20%. interaction=0.017); however, independent replication failed to validate this association. No previously proposed predictive biomarkers were validated. Our study highlights the need to validate potential pharmacogenetic biomarkers.

28281359,"The majority of breast cancer patients who receive radiation treatment are affected by acute radiation-induced skin changes. The assessment of these changes is usually done by subjective methods, which complicates the comparison between different treatments or patient groups. This study investigates the feasibility of new robust methods for monitoring skin microcirculation to objectively assess and quantify acute skin reactions during radiation treatment. Laser Doppler flowmetry, laser speckle contrast imaging, and polarized light spectroscopy imaging were used to measure radiation-induced changes in microvascular perfusion and red blood cell concentration (RBC) in the skin of 15 patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer. Measurements were made before treatment, once a week during treatment, and directly after the last fraction. In the treated breast, perfusion and RBC concentration were increased after 1-5 fractions (2.66-13.3?Gy) compared to baseline. The largest effects were seen in the areola and the medial area. No changes in perfusion and RBC concentration were seen in the untreated breast. In contrast, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scores were increased only after 2 weeks of treatment, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed methods for early assessment of skin changes. Also, there was a moderate to good correlation between the perfusion (r?=?0.52) and RBC concentration (r?=?0.59) and the RTOG score given a week later. We conclude that radiation-induced microvascular changes in the skin can be objectively measured using novel camera-based techniques before visual changes in the skin are apparent. Objective measurement of microvascular changes in the skin may be valuable in the comparison of skin reactions between different radiation treatments and possibly in predicting acute skin effects at an earlier stage.",skin_neoplasms
28277926,"Skin fibrosis is a clinically serious pathological process of secondary lymphedema (SLE). The detection of latent or incipient skin fibrosis, including early tissue changes, using sensitive diagnostic equipment is essential. The SkinFibroMeter has been used in skin care; however, its ability to assess skin fibrosis in patients with SLE of the lower limb has not been explored. In this study, 45 female patients with secondary unilateral lower limb LE and 15 healthy female volunteers were enrolled. The skin stiffness values of affected and healthy limbs were measured by using the SkinFibroMeter, and skin samples were assayed by Masson staining. The circumference and interstitial fluid of limbs were also measured and analyzed. Increasing skin stiffness with increasing severity of SLE of the lower limb and skin stiffness significantly positively correlated with stage of lower limb SLE. Our results demonstrate that the SkinFibroMeter is very sensitive and accurate for detecting skin fibrosis of edematous limb. Therefore, this new instrument is a promising prospect for diagnosis and assessment of skin fibrosis in patients with lower limb SLE.",skin_neoplasms
28277254,"Malignant eccrine spiradenoma is a rare and aggressive tumor, developed on the epithelium of eccrine sweat glands. Typically, it occurs after malignant transformation of benign eccrine spiradenoma, but sometimes it happens de novo. We report a case of malignant eccrine spiradenoma in a 62-year-old woman. The patient presented a rapid increase in size of a long-standing tumoral lesion of her forearm. There was no secondary lesion on the chest, abdomen or pelvis at the CT-scanner. Cutaneous biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed a carcinoma with no contact with epidermis. On this biopsy, we could not affirm if the tumor was a metastatic process or a primary tumor of the skin. Histologic examination of the surgical removal of the tumor showed an undifferentiated carcinoma with adjacent nodules of eccrine spiradenoma. Immunohistochemical assessment of Ki67 expression showed a weak expression (5%) in the benign spiradenoma nodules and a high rate expression (80%) in the malignant neoplasm. The final diagnosis was an undifferentiated carcinoma arising from preexisting benign spiradenoma. Malignant eccrine spiradenoma is not frequent and is rarely described in the international literature that may lead to diagnostic difficulties.",skin_neoplasms
28275427,"Phyllodes tumors are uncommon biphasic fibroepithelial neoplasms of the breast of varying malignant potential occurring in middle aged women. They exhibit diverse biological behavior. Margin free excision is the mainstay of treatment. A 27 year-old lady was referred with a painless ulceroproliferative right breast lesion which had rapidly progressed over six months. Three years back, she had been diagnosed with a borderline phyllodes tumor and underwent a wide local excision followed by a right mastectomy for recurrence. The resection margins were positive hence she underwent postoperative radiation. We performed a radical resection of the chest wall and reconstruction using a composite mesh (inner PTFE and outer vypro), pedicled latissimus dorsi flap and a split skin graft for the recurrent malignant tumor. She recovered uneventfully thereafter. Malignant phyllodes tumor is uncommon and treatment principles are from case reports and retrospective studies. Aggressive resection of the lesion and reconstruction of the chest wall with bone cement and two meshes-a composite mesh (inner layer -polytetrafluroethylene and outer layer of polypropylene) and a Vypro mesh is a possibility. This case highlights the challenges encountered in managing these patients and presents a radical solution. Treatment of phyllodes tumor necessitates adequate excision of the tumor and adjacent tissues to ensure tumor free margins. Pathological evolution from intermediate to malignant histology may be exhibited. A full-thickness chest wall resection and reconstruction although radical is a feasible option as these tumors rarely respond to other modalities of cancer management.",skin_neoplasms
28274179,"Lymphatic fistulas are common complications after lymph node dissections in melanoma patients. We investigated whether drain management could improve the patient's outcome. Patients who underwent axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection (RALND or RILND) for malignant melanoma were recorded in a prospective database. Two different methods of drain management were compared. Either the drain was removed no later than the eighth postoperative day (period I, 2003-2007) or it was left in place until fluid flow was below 50?ml in 24?h for two consecutive days (period II, 2008-2011). The main outcome criterion was the incidence of seroma punctures after drain removal. 374 patients were analysed. The incidence of seroma punctures significantly decreased in period II. The number of patients with elevated lymphatic secretions rose by 41.3% (RALND) and 38.1% (RILND). With the exception of lymphatic fistulas, we observed significantly more local complications with need for treatment in period I (n?=?104, 52%) than in period II (n?=?31, 18%). In period II, the hospital stays after both procedures were significantly reduced. We conclude that quantity-guided drain management leads to a prolonged interval of drainage but is associated with a lower incidence of seroma formation and shorter hospital stay.",skin_neoplasms
28272287,"Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) may be at higher risk of malignancy after liver transplantation (LT) compared to other LT recipients. We aimed to determine the cumulative incidence of/risk factors for long-term cancer-related mortality in patients with PSC after LT. All adult patients underwent LT for PSC without cholangiocarcinoma from 1984 to 2012, with follow-up through June 2015. We estimated cumulative incidence, risk factors, and mortality from de novo malignancies after LT. Two hundred ninety-three patients were identified (mean [SD] age, 47 [12] years; 63.3% males; 2.4% smoking at LT). Over a median of 11.5 years (range, 6.4-18.6 years), 64 patients (21.8%) developed 73 nonskin cancers, including 46 solid-organ cancers (renal, 11; colorectal, 11; prostate, 7; breast, 5; pancreas, 5; ovarian/endometrial/vulvar cancers, 3; and de novo cholangiocarcinoma, 4). Twenty-two patients developed hematologic malignancies (posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases, 18; Hodgkin disease, 2; and myelodysplastic syndrome, 2). Five patients developed melanoma. The 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year cumulative incidences of cancer were 2.1%, 8.6%, 18.7%, and 27%, respectively. Mortality of patients with PSC who developed cancer was higher than that of patients with PSC without cancer (hazard ratio, 2.2; P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, recipient's age and elevated pre-LT international normalized ratio were associated with increased risk of de novo (nonskin) malignancy. The 10-year cumulative risk of cancer after LT for advanced-stage PSC was 18.7%, with posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases, colorectal cancer, and renal cell cancer being the most common. Post-LT de novo nonskin cancer decreased overall posttransplant survival. Only recipient's age and elevated international normalized ratio at LT were associated with increased nonskin cancer risk.",skin_neoplasms

It allows like-with-like reconstruction with placement of the scars in natural creases or subunit junctions. In this article, the authors describe their refined technique to specifically address moderate to large size defects of the frontotemporal, preauricular, and zygomatic regions. Thirty consecutive patients underwent reconstruction with the extended A-T plasty at our institution after skin cancer excision. Mean age at surgery was 63 years (range, 39-87 years). Mean defect size was 5.2 ?? 4.7 cm. The defects were located in the frontotemporal (13), upper preauricular (10), and zygomatic (7) facial subunits. Mean operative time was 65 minutes. Three (10%) patients suffered from delayed healing at the T junction, with no impairment in the long-term follow-up.

28270164,"Patients with germline mutations in a tumour suppressor gene called CYLD develop multiple, disfiguring, hair follicle tumours on the head and neck. The prognosis is poor, with up to one in four mutation carriers requiring complete surgical removal of the scalp. There are no effective medical alternatives to treat this condition. Whole genome molecular profiling experiments led to the discovery of an attractive molecular target in these skin tumour cells, named tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK), upon which these cells demonstrate an oncogenic dependency in preclinical studies. Recently, the development of an ointment containing a TRK inhibitor (pegcantratinib - previously CT327 - from Creabilis SA) allowed for the assessment of TRK inhibition in tumours from patients with inherited CYLD mutations. Tropomysin Receptor Antagonism in Cylindromatosis (TRAC) is a two-part, exploratory, early phase, single-centre trial. Cohort 1 is a phase 1b open-labelled trial, and cohort 2 is a phase 2a randomised double-blinded exploratory placebo-controlled trial. Cohort 1 will determine the safety and acceptability of applying pegcantratinib for 4?weeks to a single tumour on a CYLD mutation carrier that is scheduled for a routine lesion excision (n?=?8 patients). Cohort 2 will investigate if CYLD defective tumours respond following 12?weeks of treatment with pegcantratinib. As patients have multiple tumours, we intend to treat 10 tumours in each patient, 5 with active treatment and 5 with placebo. Patients will be allocated both active and placebo treatments to be applied randomly to tumours on the left or right side. The target is to treat 150 tumours in a maximum of 20 patients. Tumour volume will be measured at baseline and at 4 and 12?weeks. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of tumours responding to treatment by 12?weeks, based on change in tumour volume, with secondary measures based on adverse event profile, treatment compliance and acceptability, changes in tumour volume and surface area, patient quality of life and pain. Interventions for rare genetic skin diseases are often difficult to assess in an unbiased way due to small patient numbers and the challenges of incorporating adequate controls into trial design. Here we present a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial design that leverages the multiplicity of tumours seen in an inherited skin tumour syndrome that may inform the design of other studies in similar genetic diseases.

In this study, we try to evaluate the outcome of this flap in oncoplastic procedures. This study included 40 patients of stage II breast cancer who underwent partial mastectomy with skin excision at the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University between 2011 and 2014. The resultant defects were immediately reconstructed using the thoracodorsal artery perforator flap. Operative time and complication rates were recorded. The cosmetic outcome was assessed through a questionnaire. The mean operative time was 227min. The total complication rate was 20% with flap congestion being the most common complication. The cosmetic outcome was acceptable with 80% of patients rating their outcome as either good or excellent. The subjectively assessed functional outcome showed a mean time of 10days postoperative for patients to regain their full range of shoulder movements.

28267696,"Cutaneous radiation therapy (RT)-associated breast angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare consequence of breast RT associated with poor outcomes. Previous small case series have documented high recurrence rates and poor survival. We reviewed our experience and focused on the impact of conservative versus radical resections. Data for patients with RT-associated breast AS evaluated at our institution from 1993 to 2015 who underwent surgery were reviewed. Seventy-six women were diagnosed with RT-associated breast AS at a median 85 months from surgery for invasive breast carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ. Thirty-eight underwent mastectomy/wide excision with partial skin resection (""conservative"") and 38 underwent resection of all or nearly all previously irradiated skin plus mastectomy (""radical""). The radical group (vs the conservative group) more often had multifocal disease (80% vs 56%, P = 0.04), chemotherapy for AS (58% vs 22%, P < 0.01), margin-negative resection (100% vs 73%, P < 0.01), reconstructive surgery (100% vs 13%, P < 0.01), and re-operation (16% vs 3%, P = 0.04). Five-year crude cumulative incidences of local recurrence and distant metastasis for radical versus conservative groups were 23% versus 76% (P < 0.01) and 18% versus 47% (P = 0.02), respectively. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) for radical versus conservative groups was 86% versus 46% (P < 0.01), respectively. On multivariable analysis, age, radicality of surgery, and margin were predictive of DSS. For patients with RT-associated breast AS, radical resection was associated with reduced recurrence rates and improved DSS. Although margin was predictive of DSS, multifocality calls into question the reliability of negative margin assessment.",skin_neoplasms
28267542,"To find out, if ultrasound elastography of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can predict patterns of tumor perfusion in volume perfusion computed tomography (VPCT). ?? software were used. A total of 43 HCC lesions were assessed. Mean shear wave velocity was 2.6m/s (range, 1.1-4.3m/s). There was no significant linear correlation between the elasticity values and BF (p=0.751), BV (p=0.426) and HPI (p=0.437). However, elasticity values were higher, the larger the tumor was (p=0.008). Shear wave velocity declined with increasing distance of the HCC to the skin surface (p=0.028) and depending on liver segment. In addition, elasticity values were higher in less differentiated HCCs. This trend was not statistically significant (p=0.842). Tissue elasticity in HCC does not correlate with the degree of tumor vascularization, but calculated values are influenced both by the tumor size and localization inside the liver.",skin_neoplasms
28264791,"Despite the efficacy of innovative treatments for metastatic melanoma, their high costs has led to disparities in cancer care among different European countries. We analysed the availability of these innovative therapies in Europe?and estimated the number of patients without access to first-line recommended treatment per current guidelines of professional entities such as the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), and European Dermatology Forum (EDF). Web-based online survey was conducted in 30 European countries with questions about the treatment schedules from 1st May 2015 to 1st May 2016: number of metastatic melanoma patients, registration and reimbursement of innovative medicines (updated data, as of 1st October 2016), percentage of patients treated and availability of clinical studies and compassionate-use programmes. The recommended BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)?+?MEK inhibitor (MEKi) combination was both registered and fully reimbursed in 9/30 (30%) countries, and in 13/30 (43%) (all from Eastern Europe) not reimbursed. First-line immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies was registered and fully reimbursed in 14/30 (47%) countries, while in 13/30 (43%) (all from Eastern Europe) not reimbursed. It was estimated that in Europe 19,600 patients with metastatic melanoma are treated, and 5238 (27%) do not have access to recommended first-line therapy. Significant correlation was found between human development index (HDI, UNDP report 2015), (r?=?0.662; p?<?0.001), health expenditure per capita (r?=?0.695; p?<?0.001) and the Mackenbach score of health policy performance (r?=?0.765; p?<?0.001) with the percentage of patients treated with innovative medicines and a number of reimbursed medicines.

Introduction of the Berlin Morphology criteria has shown potential improvement up to 65-80% in selected patients. This cohort study evaluates the long-term survival outcome of melanoma patients undergoing Ultrasound (US) guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) prior to sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or direct lymphadenectomy. Between 2001 and 2010 over 1000 consecutive melanoma patients prospectively underwent targeted US-FNAC prior to SNB. The Berlin US morphology criteria: peripheral perfusion (PP), loss of central echoes (LCE) and balloon shape (BS) were registered. FNAC was performed if any factor was present. All patients underwent SNB or lymphadenectomy in case of positive FNAC. Median follow-up was 61 months (IQR 40-95). SN positivity rate was 21%. Survival analyses demonstrated that patients with positive US-FNAC had poor survival. After adjustment for SN status and other known prognostic features, patients with positive US-FNAC (hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.10-2.96) had worse survival than patients with normal US (reference). Patients with suspicious US and negative FNAC (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71-1.78) had survival comparable to patients with normal US. The long-term US-FNAC results support this step-wise approach to melanoma patients. Patients with positive US-FNAC have a poor survival and can be spared a SNB. Patients with suspicious US and negative FNAC should undergo SNB to detect microscopic occult disease. Completely US-FNAC negative patients might only require follow-up and no SN staging at all.",skin_neoplasms

We sought to explore the correlation of specific mastectomy type with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), body image satisfaction, and the reconstructed breast's role in intimacy. This study is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey including a retrospective chart review. Patients at least one year from primary surgery were invited to complete the survey between 2012 and 2014. Baseline characteristics and survey responses were compared between three mastectomy groups: total/modified radical (TMRM), skin-sparing (SSM), and nipple-sparing (NSM). All patients underwent reconstruction. Of 453 invited, 268 (59%) completed the survey. Sixty underwent mastectomy with reconstruction: 16 (27%) TMRM, 36 (60%) SSM, and 8 (13%) NSM. There were no significant differences in median total FSFI scores between groups, yet median FSFI scores for the NSM group indicated sexual dysfunction. After adjusting for receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation, NSM had the lowest median desire score. There was a trend for the NSM group to be the least satisfied with postoperative appearance, but also more likely to report that the chest was ""often"" caressed during intimacy. However, nearly 40% of the NSM group reported that caress of the reconstructed breast was unpleasant. NSM offers patients the greatest opportunity for preservation of their native skin envelope and potentially enhanced cosmetic outcome, but our results did not demonstrate superior sexual function or body image outcomes in this group. By highlighting surgical consequences of mastectomy preoperatively, surgeons may better set realistic patient expectations regarding both aesthetic and functional outcomes after breast cancer surgery.

They were included in 1 of 3 therapeutic groups: group 1, STSG using CDM (n?= 29); group 2, STSG using BDM (n?= 20); and group 3, STSG only (n?= 23). Functional skin values for skin elasticity, humidification, transepidermal water loss, and color were determined. Values were compared between graft sites and adjacent normal (control) skin, and between grafted areas of each group. All skin defects were successfully reconstructed without graft loss. Groups 1 and 2 demonstrated better elasticity than did group 3, based on the analysis using the ratio of grafted area to control. Grafted areas in all 3 groups exhibited less moisture than did control normal skin. There was less transepidermal water loss in group 1 than in group 3, which implied that CDM application had better barrier capacity against water evaporation. Graft sites of groups 1 and 3 exhibited darker and redder color compared with control areas. Composite forearm defects were successfully restored and exhibited acceptable quality after treatment with an ADM plus STSG. Applying either CDM or BDM under a STSG was a suitable procedure, as verified by objective measurements. Elasticity was well preserved in CDM and BDM groups.

The optional BRFSS cancer survivorship module was introduced in 2009. Data from Alabama (2012), Georgia (2012), and Mississippi (2014) were assessed. Demographic factors were analyzed through weighted regression for risk of receiving cancer treatment summary information and follow-up care. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer cases, a total of 1105 adults in the Alabama 2012 survey, 571 adults in the Georgia 2012 survey, and 442 adults in the 2014 Mississippi survey reported ever having cancer and were available for analysis. Among Alabamians, those with a higher level of education (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.7) and higher income (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) were more likely to receive a written summary of their cancer treatments. Adults older than age 65 were only half as likely to receive a written summary of cancer treatments compared with adults 65 years or younger (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8). We found no significant differences in receipt of treatment summary by race or sex. Among those who reported receiving instructions from a doctor for follow-up care, these survivors tended to have a higher level of education, higher income, and were younger (younger than 65 years). Receipt of written or printed follow-up care was positively associated with higher income (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) and inversely associated with age older than 65 years (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.1-0.6) in Georgia.

This project aimed to develop and evaluate a resource that could be used to provide essential information to patients who were nearing completion of the surgical treatment of their cancer. The study compared patients with melanoma, colorectal and breast cancers who received standard discussion of their diagnosis, treatment and follow-up plan with cancer patients who received a discussion supported by an individualised follow-up booklet. Patients were interviewed using an over-the-phone questionnaire to assess their free recall and prompted recall of follow-up items, their perception of the level of information received and satisfaction with the communication of their follow-up plan. The group who received a booklet as part of discussion of their follow-up plan scored significantly higher on measures of free recall, prompted recall, satisfaction with the level of information provided and overall satisfaction than those who had a standard clinic discussion but did not receive a booklet. Free recall of two relevant items improved from 61% of patients to 91%. Prompted recall of at least one item improved from 77% of patients to 100%. The proportion of patients feeling they did not receive enough information fell from 25% to 5%. The proportion of patients scoring their satisfaction at >8/10 increased from 68% to 87%. All of these measures reached significance. Individualised cancer follow-up booklets are a simple, low-cost and low-risk initiative that used in a New Zealand setting, was associated with improved patient recall and satisfaction with the follow-up information they received.

Rapid local progression led to colocutaneous fistula with total fecal diversion. We performed an extended right hemicolectomy with en bloc excision of the hernia sac and infiltrating cutaneous mass. In the current era of widespread use of screening colonoscopies, initial diagnosis of locally advanced colon cancer is decreasing. However, this unique case presented an opportunity to recall the advantages of multivisceral resections.",skin_neoplasms

MF-required immunosuppressive therapies and MF-related immunosuppressive characteristics render patients with MF more prone to infections. To describe the clinical features of cutaneous infections observed in MF patients. A series of 56 MF patients were followed prospectively over 3 years and screened for cutaneous infections. Prospective observational study. Four herpes simplex virus type-I (HSV-I), 2 staphylococcal (S. aureus) impetiginizations and 2 Malassezia infections were detected in single isolated plaque/patch stage MF as well as 1 varicella zoster virus infection (herpes zoster, HZ) and 2 cases of cellulitis in 10 patients. All patients presented advanced MF. All the diagnoses were delayed due to atypical clinical presentations. Patients with advanced MF should be particularly monitored for skin infections, especially by HSV and S. aureus. Unexplained exacerbation or the sudden appearance of oozing or ulcerations in MF lesions should initiate a search for viral or bacterial agents. Cellulitis and HZ can be severer and prolonged in MF patients.",skin_neoplasms
28249074,"Actinic keratosis (AK), a skin growth induced by ultraviolet light exposure, requires chronic management because a small proportion can progress into squamous cell skin cancer. Spending for AK management was more than $1 billion in 2004. Investigating geographic variation in AK spending presents an opportunity to decrease waste or recoup excess spending. To evaluate geographic variation in health care cost for management of AKs and the association with patient-related and health-related factors. This retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the MarketScan medical claims database of 488?324 continuously enrolled members with 2 or more claims for AK. Data from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, was used. Annual costs of care were calculated for outpatient visits, AK destruction, and medications for AKs, and the total of these components. Costs were adjusted for inflation to 2014 US dollars. To display cost variation, we calculated the ratio of mean cost in the highest quintile (Q5) relative to the mean in the lowest quintile (Q1), or the Q5:Q1 ratio; Q5:Q1 ratios were adjusted based on age, sex, history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, US geographic region, and population density (metropolitan statistical area). Overall, data from 488?324 continuously enrolled members (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [7.5] years; 243?662 women) with 2 or more claims for AK were included. Overall, patients had 1?085?985 claims related to AK, and dermatologists accounted for 71.0% of claims. The 2-year total cost was $111.5 million, with $52.4 million in 2011 and $59.1 million in 2012. The unadjusted Q5:Q1 ratios for total annual cost per patient ranged from 9.49 to 15.10. Adjusted ratios ranged from 1.72 to 1.80. There is variation in AK management cost within and between regions. This is not fully explained by differences in patient characteristics such as age, sex, or comorbidities. The annual cost for 10 common conditions from Medicare had lower Q5:Q1 ratios that ranged from 1.33 (joint degeneration of back/neck) to 1.69 (chronic sinusitis) when compared with 1.72 to 1.80 for AKs. This suggests an opportunity to investigate and improve the value of health care delivery in the management of AKs.",skin_neoplasms
28245782,"The body of evidence available from published literature during the past three decades indicates that reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species can induce, promote and modulate carcinogenesis. The purpose of this review was to present the current status of knowledge on the possible role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the development and progression of several human cancers. Moreover, we discuss briefly the formation and decomposition of oxygen and nitrogen species within cells and their physiological and damaging influences. Given that some antitumor treatments are based on the formation of ROS, we also summarize what is currently known about supplementing the diet with antioxidants. We conducted literature searches to review the recent progress toward the potential role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and associated oxidative stress in carcinogenesis. The epidemiological and laboratory studies showed that excessive production of reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species may lead to consequent alteration in the intracellular homeostasis and cause damage to all important cellular components when the excess of oxidants is not balanced by antioxidant defence and/or DNA repair mechanisms. Chronic oxidative stress can drive carcinogenesis by altering expression of cancer-related genes causing mutation and transformation. There is now common agreement that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are involved in the development and progression of several human cancers like breast, prostate, colorectal, gynecological, cervical, eye, skin, leukemia, gastric. Antioxidant supplements at low doses can promote health, while excess supplementation can be harmful and even carcinogenic.",skin_neoplasms

However, contralateral nodal metastasis is seen frequently in a certain group of patients. Identifying those factors associated with higher chances of contralateral nodal metastasis may help in optimizing the treatment. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors associated with contralateral nodal metastasis in cases of buccal mucosa cancers. A retrospective audit of 125 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of buccal mucosa at a tertiary cancer center. Those cases in which lesions were reaching or crossing midline were included in this study. All cases underwent surgery as primary modality of treatment and had bilateral neck dissection. Chi-square test is used for evaluating the variables predicting contralateral nodal metastasis. Finally, a multivariate analysis was performed using binomial logistic regression to identify those variables that were independently associated with the risk of contralateral nodal metastasis. Among 125 patients, 53 cases were node negative. Ipsilateral nodal metastasis was seen in 44/125 (35.2%) patients, 26/125 (20.8%) had bilateral neck node metastasis, and 2/125 (1.6%) had isolated contralateral nodal metastasis. Among these 28 patients with contralateral nodal metastasis, 26 patients had ipsilateral nodal metastasis. Ipsilateral nodal metastasis and skin involvement were independently predictive of contralateral nodal metastasis. Contralateral nodal metastasis in the absence of ipsilateral nodal metastasis is very rare and frozen section of ipsilateral neck dissection specimen can be an important pointer for addressing contralateral neck.",skin_neoplasms

Radiation-induced skin toxicity is the major adverse event experienced by patients; however, radiodermatitis (RD) prevention and management remains trivial. It is proven that photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy using light-emitting diode (LED) increases wound healing and depicts an anti-inflammatory effect. This single-institute study evaluates the beneficial role of PBM-LED in preventing/reducing RD during breast cancer RT. Of 70?consecutively treated patients, 25?patients were treated with PBM-LED twice a?week prior to adjuvant 3D conformal RT after breast-conserving surgery. RD was reported using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version?4.0 and pain intensity using a?visual analog scale (VAS). For comparison, a?control group (n?= 45) received RT without PBM-LED. In addition, a?""matched"" group (n?= 25) was generated from the control group based on propensity for potentially confounding variables. In the PBM group, 22?patients (88%) presented grade?1 and 3 (12%) grade?2 RD. In the control group, 25?patients (55.6%) developed grade?1 reactions, 18?patients (40%) grade?2, and 2 (4.4%) patients grade?3 RD.

Currently, wide local excision (WLE) is the standard of care. However, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is now used to treat a growing subset of individuals with MIS. During MMS, unlike WLE, the entire cutaneous surgical margin is evaluated intraoperatively for tumor cells. To assess the outcomes of patients with MIS treated with MMS compared with those treated with WLE. Retrospective review of a prospective database. The study cohort consisted of 662 patients with MIS treated with MMS or WLE per standard of care in dermatology and surgery (general surgery, otolaryngology, plastics, oculoplastics, surgical oncology) at an academic tertiary care referral center from January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2013, with follow-up through 2015. Mohs micrographic surgery or WLE. Recurrence, overall survival, and melanoma-specific survival. There were 277 patients treated with MMS (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.1] years; 62.1% male) and 385 treated with WLE (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [15.6] years; P?<?.001 for age; 54.8% male). Median follow-up was 8.6 (range, 0.2-37) years. Compared with WLE, MMS was used more frequently on the face (222 [80.2%] vs 141 [36.7%]) and scalp and neck (23 [8.3%] vs 26 [6.8%]; P?<?.001). The median (range) year of diagnosis was 2008 (1986-2013) for the MMS group vs 2003 (1978-2013) for the WLE group (P?<?.001). Overall recurrence rates were 5 (1.8%) in the MMS group and 22 (5.7%) in the WLE group (P?=?.07).

28240592,"Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) across the tofacitinib RA development programme. NMSC events (through August 2013) were identified in patients receiving tofacitinib in two Phase (P)1, eight P2, six P3 and two long-term extension (LTE) studies. In P123 studies, tofacitinib was administered at various doses (1-30 mg twice daily [BID], 20 mg once daily), as monotherapy or with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly methotrexate. In LTE studies, patients from qualifying P123 studies received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID. Crude incidence rates (IRs; patients with events/100 patient-years) for first NMSC event were evaluated across doses and over time. In the overall population, comprising data from 18 studies (15,103 patient-years), 83 of 6092 tofacitinib-treated patients had NMSC events. The IR for NMSC (0.55 [95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.69] overall population) was stable up to 84 months of observation. IRs for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID in combined P123 trials were 0.61 (0.34-1.10) and 0.47 (0.24-0.90), respectively. Corresponding IRs for LTE studies were 0.41 (0.26-0.66) and 0.79 (0.60-1.05). The IR for NMSC across the tofacitinib RA clinical development programme was low and remained stable over time.

Among lesions with blue color, the most common benign diagnoses were nevi (n?=?35, 24.3?%) and seborrheic keratoses (n?=?8, 5.6?%). Of 103 (71.5?%) lesions with a structureless blue pattern, eight (7.8?%) were entirely blue and 95 (92.2?%) were partly blue, of which 81 (78.6?%) showed peripheral or patchy and 14 (13.6?%) central blue color. Most lesions with peripheral or patchy blue color were melanomas (n?=?47, 58?%), whereas most lesions with central blue color were nevi (n?=?9, 64.3?%).

28238461,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is an examination based upon the uptake of a radioactive tracer by hypermetabolic cells. It is primarily used in tandem with tomodensitometry (PET-TDM) for cancer staging because of its high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of metastases. However, unusually high uptake may occur with benign tumours, including skin tumours. Herein, we report an extremely rare case of pathological uptake levels resulting from seborrhoeic keratosis. A 55-year-old male patient with oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was referred to us following the discovery of an area of high marker uptake following PET-TDM and corresponding to a pigmented skin lesion. No other areas of suspect high uptake were seen. The lesion was surgically excised and histological examination indicated seborrhoeic keratosis. The histological appearance was that of standard seborrhoeic keratosis without any notable mitotic activity. PET-TDM is an examination that enables diagnosis of malignancy. However, rare cases have been described of increased marker uptake by benign cutaneous tumours such as histiocytofibroma, pilomatricoma and condyloma. To date, there have only been only very few cases of increased uptake due to seborrhoeic keratosis. This extremely unusual case of increased glucose uptake in PET-TDM due to seborrhoeic keratosis confirms that the hypermetabolic activity detected by this examination is not necessarily synonymous with malignancy and that confirmation by clinical and histological findings is essential.

In this study, we report the outcomes (overall survival?[OS] and brain control?[BC]) and identify factors that associate with such outcomes in the era of modern systemic therapy. A total of 108 patients treated with SRS from 2010 to 2015 were included. Systemic treatment use within 6 weeks of SRS was noted. OS was defined as time from SRS to death or last follow-up, and BC was defined as absence of any active intracranial disease during follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed on clinico-pathological prognostic features associated with OS and BC. The median age was 64.3 years, and the median follow-up was 8.6 months. Seventy-nine (73.1%) patients received systemic treatment. The median OS were as follows: anti-CTLA4 - 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.4-15.6), anti-PD1 - 20.4 months (95% CI: 8.8 - N/A)?and BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)????MEK inhibitor (MEKi) - 17.8 months (95% CI: 11.8 - N/A).

Hypertriglyceridaemia is an unavoidable adverse effect of bexarotene therapy, and requires monitoring because of the risk of developing pancreatitis. Therefore, prophylactic hypolipidaemic therapy, usually with a fibrate alone, is required for preventing bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridaemia. Despite these measures, a large number of patients develop very severe hypertriglyceridaemia. To assess the lipid metabolism changes before and after the use of a combination of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) plus fenofibrate compared with fenofibrate alone as a more effective lipid-lowering therapy in patients with CTCL treated with bexarotene. From January 2005 to January 2013, we analysed all 25 patients with CTCL treated with bexarotene. The first 18 consecutively enrolled patients received fenofibrate alone as a lipid-lowering therapy, and the next 7 consecutively enrolled patients received a combination of fenofibrate and n-3 FA. Data for all 25 consecutive patients with CTCL treated with bexarotene were evaluated. Of these, 24 patients (96%) developed hypertriglyceridaemia despite the hypolipidaemic therapy, with this being very severe (> 11.2 mmol/L) in 20% of the cases. Of the 18 patients receiving fenofibrate alone, 5 (28%) developed very severe hypertriglyceridaemia, compared with none of the 7 patients treated with the n-3 FA combination.

Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) was used immediately after operation to determine whether the tumor was ablated completely. The complete ablation rate (CAR) and the change of focal volume were evaluated by CEUS at the 1st month and the 3rd month after operation. All the patients were diagnosed by needle biopsy. Among all the patients, 256 nodules were found. Forty-six nodules (17.96%) were located <5 mm from epidermis; 26 nodules (10.15%) were located below areola. Complete ablation was achieved for 251 nodules (98.04%) after the 1st month of operation. The volume reduce rate was 39.06% and 75.99% at the 1st and the 3rd month after operation, respectively, of which 45 nodules were completely absorbed (17.58%). There was a statistically significant difference of the volume reduction rate (VRR) after operation (P < 0.01) compared with preoperative breast nodules volume. There were no complications such as skin burn, hemorrhage, and hematoma, nipple discharge in the process during and after RFA.

The secondary objective was to correlate the cytological findings with clinical characteristics such as oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT). A retrospective review of an institutional pathology archive over a 15-year-period was performed to identify cytological samples of neovaginal vaults. The medical and surgical records of the patients identified (n=20) were evaluated. Well-preserved nucleated squamous cells were found in 70% (14/20) of patients. Neovaginal samples showing superficial, intermediate and parabasal cells plus D?derlein flora similar to normal cervical cytology were present in only 10% (2/20). Three samples (15%, 3/20) showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) that were all negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types, whereas one case was positive for low-risk (LR) HPV. One patient (5%, 1/20) was diagnosed with an HR-HPV-positive high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and one patient (5%, 1/20) had an HR- and LR-HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). The correlation between the presence of nucleated squamous cells and ERT was significant (P=.032). Cytological findings of the neovagina resemble normal cervical cytology with superficial, intermediate and parabasal cells as well as D?derlein bacilli in a minority of cases. Because precancerous lesions and invasive carcinoma may develop in the neovagina, patients with neovaginas should be subject to cancer screening programmes.",skin_neoplasms

We report for the first time, the presentation of a primary yolk sac tumor in the abdominal wall of a small child. An 18-month-old white girl underwent resection of a small, round subcutaneous lump (1.5??1.3??0.8 cm) of the abdominal wall in her right hypochondriac region. The histopathology was compatible with yolk sac tumor. Her alpha-fetoprotein was initially elevated but normalized after the resection. Magnetic resonance imaging of her abdomen was normal.

Anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated nearly equal clinical efficacy in patients who had progressed after ipilimumab or were treatment-na?ve. However, only limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of ipilimumab alone or in combination with nivolumab after treatment failure to anti-PD-therapy. A multicenter retrospective study in advanced melanoma patients who were treated with nivolumab (1 or 3?mg/kg) and ipilimumab (1?mg or 3?mg/kg) or ipilimumab (3?mg/kg) alone after treatment failure to anti-PD-1 therapy was performed. Patient, tumour, pre- and post-treatment characteristics were analysed. In total, 47 patients were treated with ipilimumab (ipi-group) and 37 patients with ipilimumab and nivolumab (combination-group) after treatment failure to anti-PD-1 therapy. Overall response rates for the ipi- and the combination-group were 16% and 21%, respectively. Disease control rate was 42% for the ipi-group and 33% for the combination-group. One-year overall survival rates for the ipi- and the combination-group were 54% and 55%, respectively. Ipilimumab should be considered as a viable treatment option for patients with failure to prior anti-PD-1 therapy, including those with progressive disease as best response to prior anti-PD-1.

One hundred patients enrolled in the registry between 2005 and 2012 were included in this prospective cohort study, and asked to participate in a follow-up survey. In addition, standardized questionnaires were used to collect data on quality of life (dermatology life quality index, DLQI) and perceived stigmatization (perceived stigmatization questionnaire, PSQ; social comfort questionnaire, SCQ). Eighty-three percent of patients (or their parents) provided answers to the survey questions (mean patient age: 11.2 years, median: 6 years; mean follow-up: 4.4 years). Overall, four individuals were diagnosed with melanoma, including two pediatric cases with CNS melanoma, one adult with cutaneous melanoma, and one case which later turned out to be a proliferative nodule. Four children were diagnosed with neurocutaneous melanocytosis, three of whom exhibited neurological symptoms. Eighty-eight percent (73/83) of patients underwent surgery. Seventy-eight percent reported no or only minor impact of the CMN on quality of life. In general, perceived stigmatization and impairment of social well-being were also low.

Management of melanoma in elderly may be difficult, mainly due to comorbidities. We report the experience of the Melanoma Unit of ASST Spedali Civili in Brescia, Italy. Study subjects were drawn from 3444 patients with histological confirmed melanoma. Data were extracted from electronic database of the Melanoma Unit of ASST Spedali Civili in Brescia, Italy. Patients who received diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma at age of 65 years or older were retrospectively evaluated. For each diagnosed melanoma, histological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated. Of the 805 patients described in this study, 444 were males and 361 females. Statistically significant differences were found between patients aged 65-80 years and those aged >80 years considering melanoma prognostic factors, such as Breslow thickness, number of mitoses/mm2 and ulceration. Older age is recognized as an independent poor prognostic factor in melanoma patients, and melanoma in older patients have a distinct natural history. It was found that management of cancer in old person represents a major challenge to medical practice. We believe that the choice of therapy should be individualized and based upon the individual's overall health and that, particularly in these cases, management often requires interdisciplinary cooperation between dermatologist, surgical specialist, oncologist and geriatrician.",skin_neoplasms

Registrations for 1606 15-24 year olds diagnosed with a new primary malignant tumor between 2000 and 2009 were obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and classified according to AYA diagnostic group and subgroup, age, sex, and prioritized ethnicity. Age-standardized incidence rates (IRs) per million person years and 5-year relative survival ratios were calculated. Cancer incidence was 228.6 per million for adolescents aged 15-19 years and 325.7 per million for young adults aged 20-24 years. Overall IRs were consistent across all ethnic groups but there were unique ethnic differences by tumor group including a higher incidence of bone tumors, carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract, and gonadal germ cell tumors among Maori, a higher incidence of leukemia among Pacific peoples, and a higher incidence of melanoma among non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples. Five-year relative survival for adolescents (75.1%) and AYA overall (80.6%) appeared poorer than had been achieved in other high-income countries. Maori (69.5%) and Pacific (71.3%) AYA had lower 5-year survival compared to non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples (84.2%).

28204937,"Reconstruction of large defects of the upper eyelid is challenging because of its complex anatomy and specialized function. The aim of this work is to develop a single-stage reconstruction procedure based on a new approach. The technique consists of the advancement of an orbicularis oculi myocutaneous flap designed within the blepharoplasty skin excision pattern. After the tumor's excision is completed with clear margins, the borders of the flap are incised down to the submuscular plane inside the classical pattern of upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Two myocutaneous triangles are excised on both sides of the flap to allow its advancement to cover the defect. When it is necessary to repair the posterior lamella, we harvest a mucochondral graft. From 2012 to 2015, we performed upper eyelid reconstruction with this technique on six patients. The flap survived in all the patients, without total or partial necrosis. No patient required surgical revision. The results were aesthetically satisfying, and no tumor recurrence was noted. Our new approach to upper eyelid reconstruction maximizes the cosmetic outcome respecting the principles of radicality. This flap is better suited for lesions involving the median or paramedian eyelid border from the marginal zone up to the palpebral crease. The approach we propose is safe and versatile, and it ensures either a functional or a good aesthetic reconstruction. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

To assess the agreement of dermatologists on identification of the ugly duckling sign and estimate the contribution of IPCA to the diagnosis of melanoma. The same 2089 digital images of the nevi of a sample of 80 patients (mean age, 42 years [range, 19-80 years]; 33 men and 47 women), as well as 766 dermoscopic images from a subset of 30 patients (mean age, 40 years [range, 21-75 years]; 12 men and 18 women), were randomly presented to the same 9 dermatologists for blinded assessment from September 22, 2011, to April 1, 2013. The first experiment was designed to mimic an IPCA situation, with images of all nevi of each patient shown to the dermatologists, who were asked to identify ugly duckling nevi (UDN). The second experiment was designed to mimic a lesion-focused analysis to identify morphologically suspicious nevi. Data analysis was conducted from November 1, 2012, to June 1, 2013. Number of nevi labeled UDN and morphologically suspicious nevi, specificity of lesion-focused analysis and IPCA, and number of nevi identified for biopsy. Of the 2089 clinical images of nevi from 80 patients (median number of nevi per patient, 26 [range, 8-81]) and 766 dermoscopic images (median number of nevi per patient, 19 [range, 8-81]), all melanomas were labeled UDN and as morphologically suspicious nevi by the 9 dermatologists. The median number of UDN detected per patient was 0.8 among the clinical images of nevi (mean, 1.0; range, 0.48-2.03) and 1.26 among the dermoscopic images (mean, 1.4; range, 1.00-2.06). The propensity to consider more or fewer nevi as having ugly duckling signs was independent of the presentation (clinical or dermoscopic). The agreement among the dermatologists regarding UDN was lower with dermoscopic images (mean pairwise agreement, 0.53 for clinical images and 0.50 for dermoscopic images). The specificity of IPCA was 0.96 for clinical images and 0.95 for dermoscopic images vs 0.88 and 0.85, respectively, for lesion-focused analysis. When both IPCA and lesion-focused analyses were used, the number of nevi considered for biopsy was reduced by a factor of 6.9 compared with lesion-focused analysis alone. Intrapatient comparative analysis is of major importance to the effectiveness of the diagnosis of melanoma. Introducing IPCA using the ugly duckling sign in computer-assisted diagnosis systems would be expected to improve performance.",skin_neoplasms

However, it is challenging to find a suitable implant for patients with small breasts, and some women fear foreign bodies and possible complications or reoperations. Autologous breast reconstruction using the pedicled latissimus dorsi (LD) myocutaneous flap without an implant provides a good option for Asian women with small breasts. Between June 1992 and December 2015, 31 patients underwent breast reconstruction with 33 LD flaps (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral). The skin paddle of the flap was designed with an oblique or transverse pattern depending on the mastectomy defect and the elasticity of skin. The thoracodorsal nerve was divided during flap harvesting to prevent a ""twitching breast"" postoperatively. Patients refused to have contralateral breast augmentation except for 2 with bilateral simultaneous augmentation after mastectomy bilaterally. Outcome measures were flap survival, shape and contour, symmetry of breast, complication of flap and donor site, patient satisfaction, and any local tumor recurrence or metastasis.

Standard treatments such as cryosurgery, electrodessication and curettage, topical and photodynamic therapies, and surgical excision including Mohs micrographic surgery are not without inherent morbidity, including risk of bleeding, infection, and scar. Lasers may be an alternative for treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and this paper reviews this therapeutic option. A comprehensive search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and PUBMED databases was performed to identify relevant literature investigating the role of laser therapy in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer. New literature regarding laser treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer is emerging, demonstrating promising clinical outcomes. The greatest efficacy has been seen with vascular-selective and ablative lasers in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas. Some success has been reported for laser treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, but data are less convincing. In summary, laser therapy offers an alternative treatment option for nonmelanoma skin cancer; however, its clinical efficacy is variable and, at this time, remains less than currently accepted standards of care.

Data included location of first recurrence and how recurrence was detected (ie patient symptom, physician examination, or routine surveillance imaging). Cox regression with backward elimination was used for multivariable analysis. One hundred and seventy-one patients had a recurrence (29.4%), the incidence increased considerably by stage sub-group. Significant predictors of recurrence included male sex (p?= 0.003), ulceration (p?= 0.03), and stage (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, male sex and stage continued to be significant (p < 0.01). For overall survival, regression, ulceration, stage, and age were significant predictors of survival. Stage, regression, and age remained significant by multivariable analysis. Patient symptoms were the most frequent mode of detection (40%), followed by physician examination (30%) and surveillance imaging (26%)-this did not differ significantly by stage. Regional nodes were the most common site of recurrence (30%), followed by lung (27%) and in-transit (18%). The majority of recurrences in stage II melanoma are detected by patients and their physicians and rarely by routine imaging.

Patients received three intradermal vaccinations of ESO/IMX-pulsed PBDC at 4-week intervals. The process was feasible and safe. No vaccine-induced immune responses were detected. Assays of immunomodulatory cells did not correlate with outcomes. One patient had a long lasting complete remission. This method was feasible and safe but was minimally immunogenic.",skin_neoplasms
28182639,"Oncological resection of the tongue can be reconstructed using a multitude of free flaps. The medial sural artery perforator (MSAP) flap has been well described in the literature in terms of its anatomy and harvest. However, functional outcome studies of post-reconstruction tongue defects using the MSAP flap have not been reported. This study represents the largest outcome study of patients with tongue reconstructions using MSAP flaps and a comprehensive review of its use. From December of 2010 to October of 2015, 579 patients with subtotal glossectomy and free flap reconstructions in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. 27 patients were reconstructed with MSAP flap. The pre- and intra-operative factors, as well as flap-related factors were analyzed. Post-operative complications and functional outcomes were evaluated. Donor site assessment were also conducted. A 96.3% flap survival rate was found with an average total operating time of 6 hours and 18 minutes. 84.6% of patients had primary closure of the donor site with and the remaining either had skin grafts or delayed closure. Donor site closure can be achieved primarily with no functional deficit. Speech intelligibility remained for most patients. 100% of patients resumed normal oral feeding. The MSAP flap is a small to medium sized flap most suited for subtotal glossectomy defects where optimal outcomes can be achieved in terms of speech clarity and restoration of oral intake.",skin_neoplasms
