29854283,"About 25% of ovarian cancers can be classified as hereditary. Of these, 80-90% are correleted with the Hereditary Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC), which is linked to BRCA 1/2 genes mutations. Our study was set up to study the BRCA-mutation incidence in Apulian population affected with ovarian cancer and to understand the characteristics of the ovarian disease BRCAmut-related. One hundred and five Apulian patients affected by ovarian cancer with serous high grade histotype, were collected. Of these, 39% were carriers of BRCA 1/2 mutation. BRCAmut patients present a lower median age of onset, a lower percentage of neoplasms in advanced stages and a lower mortality than wild type patients; BRCA-mutated patients have longer mean values of Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). Apulia is a geographical area with a significant BRCA-mutation incidence variation in the population affected by ovarian cancer. BRCAmut-related ovarian disease is characterized by an earlier median age of onset, an earlier diagnosis and a better outcome than the sporadic disease. From July 2015 to October 2017, all ovarian cancer patients with serous high grade histotype referred to our Institution were prospectly collected. A BRCA-mutation genetic testing after counselling was offered to all of these patients. Clinical characteristics of all ovarian cancer patients were evaluated. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test.",breast_neoplasms

29807951,"Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) contributes to breast cancer invasion, metastasis, and multidrug resistance. Recent studies have shown that peripheral soluble CD147 (sCD147) is increased in hepatocellular tumour and multiple myeloma patients and correlated with disease severity. The primary aim of our study was to assess the level, as well as the biological and clinical significance of sCD147 in breast cancer. We tested plasma sCD147 levels in 308 breast cancer patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between February 2014 and February 2017. A subset of 165 cases of benign breast diseases was included as a control group at the same period. We analysed the clinical significance of plasma sCD147 with relevance to clinicopathological factors of breast cancer patients. Plasma sCD147 levels were significantly higher in patients with primary breast cancer than those with benign breast diseases (P=0.001), in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (T3-T4 tumour) than those in early breast cancer (T1-T2 tumour; P=0.001), in patients with lymph node metastasis than in those without (P<0.001), and in patients with high recurrence risk than those with medium recurrence risk (P<0.001). Plasma sCD147 levels were also significantly higher in the chemotherapy-resistant group than in the chemotherapy-sensitive group (P=0.040). Plasma sCD147 was an independent predictor for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients (P=0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate that plasma sCD147 levels are elevated in breast cancer patients. Soluble CD147 is also associated with tumour size, lymph node metastasis, high recurrent risk, and chemoresistance. Our findings support that plasma sCD147 is an independent predictive factor for lymph node metastasis.",breast_neoplasms

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding their prevalence among older patients with cancer. The current study was a secondary analysis combining 2 prospective cohorts of adults aged ¡Ã65 years with solid tumors who were receiving chemotherapy. The authors assessed the association between patient-reported hearing and/or visual impairment (defined as fair/poor grading by self-report) and physical function, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), anxiety, depression, and cognition. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize patient and treatment characteristics. One-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests were conducted as appropriate to examine differences between patients with and without sensory impairments. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between sensory impairments and outcomes. Among 750 patients with a median age of 72 years who had solid tumors (29% with breast/gynecological tumors, 28% with lung tumors, and 27% with gastrointestinal tumors), approximately 18% reported hearing impairment alone, 11% reported visual impairment alone, and 7% reported dual sensory impairment.

29785157,"Cancer is a leading cause of death in Ecuador with high social and economic impact. This study aims to determinate the influence of living at a high altitude on the risk of developing or dying from cancer among the Ecuadorian population. This is an ecological and epidemiological analysis of cancer mortality and prevalence rates, based on national data from the Ecuadorian National Statistics and Census Institute, corresponding to the period between 2005 and 2014. This study includes the analysis of various types of cancer: gastric, colorectal, hepatic/bile duct, breast, uterine/cervix, and lymphatic/hematopoietic, using rates of mortality and prevalence. Additionally, the association between the risk of getting or dying from cancer and living at high altitude was investigated. This comparison was made between the population living in Highlands, over 2000 meters above sea level, and low-lying regions. Living at high altitude was associated with a higher prevalence of cancer and also with a high mortality rate due to cancer. Risk of getting cancer was related to living at a higher altitude, as well as an increased risk of death by cancer: gastric (OR:1.204; p<0.001), colorectal (OR:1.421; p<0.001), hepatic/bile duct (OR:1.184; p<0.001), breast (OR:1.067; p=0.030), or lymphatic/hematopoietic neoplasms (OR:1.135; p<0.001). Through an epidemiologic analysis, the association between developing or dying from cancer and living at high altitude was obtained. However, further researche is needed to clarify these findings, something that could have a substantial impact on cancer prevention.",breast_neoplasms
29771766,"We conducted a study in order to assess the prevalence of extrapancreatic malignancies (EPMs) in a cohort of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) from northeast of Italy. A study was conducted in hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Udine, Italy. Hospital records were screened in order to identify newly diagnosed IPMN cases in the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2015. We searched for EPMs diagnosed previous to, synchronous to, or after the IPMN. The ratio of the observed (O) number of patients with EPMs to the expected (E) was calculated. We identified 72 EPMs in 63 (31.8%) of 198 patients included. Among them, 51 (70.8%) were diagnosed previous to, 17 (23.6%) synchronous to, and 4 (5.6%) after the IPMN. Most frequently diagnosed were colorectal (12 patients [6.1%]), breast (8 patients [6.8%, in females]), renal cell (8 patients [4.0%]), and prostate cancer (7 patients [8.6%, in males]). The O/E ratios for EPMs were significantly increased for cancer in general (3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.39-5.37), renal cell (9.62; 95% CI, 1.98-28.10), prostate (4.91; 95% CI, 1.59-11.45), and breast cancer (3.16; 95% CI, 1.03-7.37). We report an increased risk of EPMs in patients with IPMN, especially for renal cell, prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29768356,"Metastases of breast carcinoma to the main bronchus and choroid are rare, but have been reported in relevant literature. Late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma after more than 20 years is extremely rare. Herein, we report a 57-year-old woman with late distant recurrence and metastasis to the main bronchus and choroid almost 28 years after surgery. At the age of 29, the patient underwent chemotherapy and endocrine treatment after a right side mastectomy to remove breast carcinoma. The patient was hospitalized for a cough with blood-tinged sputum, dysphagia, and blurred vision in the left eye at the age of 57. On evaluation, laboratory findings detected the elevated serum tumor markers of CA12-5, CA15-3, NSE, and Cyfra21-1. The imaging showed left lung metastase, multiple lymph node metastases, and small suspected metastases in the both sides of parietal lobes. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed choroidal occupying lesion of the left side which indicates secondary metastasis and retinal detachment. Combined with the pathological finding via fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy, the patient was clinically diagnosed with a late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma. The patient received oral endocrine therapy of letrozole, but she refused chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other topical treatments. At the 3-month follow-up visit, the multiple lesions of the left lung and lymph nodes had partially regressed, and the lesion of right parietal lobe had disappeared. The patient's clinical symptoms, such as blood-tinged sputum and dysphagia, had significantly improved. We have described this case and reviewed the relevant literature concerning late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma. Importantly, this case indicates that patients with HR positive breast carcinoma are more likely to develop late distant recurrence and clinicians should not ignore the follow-up examinations even more than 20 years after the surgery.",breast_neoplasms
29768327,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increases breast conservation rates in patients with resectable breast cancer at the associated cost of higher locoregional recurrence rates; however, the magnitude of the survival benefits of NAC for these patients remains undefined. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the survival benefit of NAC versus postoperative chemotherapy by conducting an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The authors searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese biomedical literature database, and Chinese Scientific Journals full-text database from their inception to December 2016. The authors identified relevant RCTs that compared NAC with postoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of operable breast cancer. The main endpoints were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A total of 21 citations representing 16 unique studies were eligible. There were 787 deaths among 2794 patients assigned to NAC groups and 816 deaths among 2799 patients assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy groups. A meta-analysis of data indicated that there was no significant benefit in terms of OS ([hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.13, P?=?.51) and RFS (HR?=?1.01, 95% CI: 0.93-1.10, P?=?.80) between the NAC and postoperative chemotherapy groups. The pooled HR estimate for OS was not influenced by NAC cycles, the total number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of tamoxifen, administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, or type of NAC regimen. Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled HR estimate for RFS was influenced by anthracycline-containing regimens. Patients with a pathological complete response had superior survival outcomes compared with patients who had residual disease. The survival benefits for patients with operable breast cancer who received either NAC or adjuvant chemotherapy based on anthracycline regimens were comparable.",breast_neoplasms
29766637,"Tumor expression of certain coagulation factors have been linked to cancer progression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in F5 (encoding the FV protein) have been found associated with breast cancer, however, the role of coagulation factor V (FV) in cancer pathogenesis remains undiscovered. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of FV and the regulatory role of F5 gene variants in breast cancer. A Scandinavian 503-sample breast cancer cohort and three public breast cancer data sets (GOBO, TCGA, and KM plotter) were used to determine associations between F5 gene expression (tumor-specific), circulating FV, F5 SNPs, clinical characteristics, and breast cancer survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect FV antigen in tumors. F5 expression was 2-fold higher in breast tumors compared to normal tissue, and the presence of FV antigen in breast tumors was confirmed by IHC staining. F5 expression was increased in patients with hormone receptor negative tumors, triple negative tumors, HER2 enriched- and basal-like tumors. In patients with basal tumors, high expression of F5 was associated with improved overall survival (HR=0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.86). SNPs in F5 were associated with tumor size and luminal A tumors. The rs6427202-rs9332542 C-G haplotype, previously associated with breast cancer, displayed a cis-regulatory effect on F5 expression in tumors and plasma FV antigen levels. In silico mining supported this regulatory function. FV was a possible marker of aggressive breast cancer, yet also a predictor of favorable outcome. Evaluation of FV expression may be clinically useful for prognosis and treatment decisions in aggressive breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",breast_neoplasms
29761357,"To examine the capability of MRI texture analysis to differentiate the primary site of origin of brain metastases following a radiomics approach. Sixty-seven untreated brain metastases (BM) were found in 3D T1-weighted MRI of 38 patients with cancer: 27 from lung cancer, 23 from melanoma and 17 from breast cancer. These lesions were segmented in 2D and 3D to compare the discriminative power of 2D and 3D texture features. The images were quantized using different number of gray-levels to test the influence of quantization. Forty-three rotation-invariant texture features were examined. Feature selection and random forest classification were implemented within a nested cross-validation structure. Classification was evaluated with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) considering two strategies: multiclass and one-versus-one. In the multiclass approach, 3D texture features were more discriminative than 2D features. The best results were achieved for images quantized with 32 gray-levels (AUC = 0.873 ¡¾ 0.064) using the top four features provided by the feature selection method based on the p-value. In the one-versus-one approach, high accuracy was obtained when differentiating lung cancer BM from breast cancer BM (four features, AUC = 0.963 ¡¾ 0.054) and melanoma BM (eight features, AUC = 0.936 ¡¾ 0.070) using the optimal dataset (3D features, 32 gray-levels). Classification of breast cancer and melanoma BM was unsatisfactory (AUC = 0.607 ¡¾ 0.180). Volumetric MRI texture features can be useful to differentiate brain metastases from different primary cancers after quantizing the images with the proper number of gray-levels. ? Texture analysis is a promising source of biomarkers for classifying brain neoplasms. ? MRI texture features of brain metastases could help identifying the primary cancer. ? Volumetric texture features are more discriminative than traditional 2D texture features.",breast_neoplasms
29753316,"ZFX is a transcriptional regulator in embryonic stem cells that plays an important role in pluripotency and self-renewal. ZFX is widely expressed in pluripotent stem cells and is down-regulated during differentiation of embryonic stem cells. ZFX has five different variants that encode three different protein isoforms. While several reports have determined the overexpression of ZFX in a variety of somatic cancers, the expression of ZFX-spliced variants in cancer cells is not well-understood. We investigated the expression of ZFX variants in a series of breast cancer tissues and cell lines using quantitative PCR. The expression of ZFX variant 1/3 was higher in tumor tissue compared to marginal tissue. In contrast, the ZFX variant 5 was down-regulated in tumor tissues. While the ZFX variant 1/3 and ZFX variant 5 expression significantly increased in low-grade tumors, ZFX variant 4 was strongly expressed in high-grade tumors and demonstrating lymphatic invasion. In addition, our result revealed a significant association between the HER2 status and the expression of ZFX-spliced variants. Our data suggest that the expression of ZFX-spliced transcripts varies between different types of breast cancer and may contribute to their tumorigenesis process. Hence, ZFX-spliced transcripts could be considered as novel tumor markers with a probable value in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

We found a change in risk-reducing (RR) management patterns after December 2012, when the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) of Korea began to pay for BRCA testing and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in pathogenic-variant carriers. The study group consisted of 992 patients, including 705 with breast cancer (BC), 23 with ovarian cancer (OC), 10 with both, and 254 relatives of high-risk patients who underwent BRCA testing at the National Cancer Center of Korea from January 2008 to December 2016.We analyzed patterns of and factors in RR management. Of the 992 patients, 220 (22.2%) were carriers of BRCA pathogenic variants. About 92.3% (203/220) had a family history of BC and/or OC, which significantly differed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (p<0.001). All 41 male carriers chose surveillance. Of the 179 female carriers, 59 (71.1%) of the 83 carriers with BC and the 39 (49.4%) of 79 unaffected carriers underwent RR management. None of the carriers affected with OC underwent RR management. Of the management types, RRSO had the highest rate (42.5%) of patient choice. The rate of risk-reducing surgery was significantly higher after 2013 than before 2013 (46.3% [74/160] vs. 31.6% [6/19], p<0.001).

29743060,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and affects 1.38 million women worldwide per year. Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, are widely used in clinics to treat ER-positive breast tumors. However, remissions of breast cancer are often followed by resistance to tamoxifen and disease relapse. Despite the increasing understanding of the resistance mechanisms, effective regimens for treating tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer are limited. Antrodia cinnamomea is a traditional medicinal mushroom native only to Taiwan. In this study, we aimed to examine in vitro effect of antrodia cinnamomea in the tamoxifen-resistant cancer. Antrodia cinnamomea was studied for its biological activity against proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer by XTT assay. Next, the underlying mechanism was studied by flow cytometry, qPCR and Western's blotting assay. -?6?M tamoxifen have the better inhibitory effect on the proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells than only AC did. AC can induce apoptosis in these breast cancer cells. Moreover, it can suppress the mRNA expression of skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) by increasing the expressions of miR-21-5p, miR-26-5p, and miR-30-5p in MCF-7 and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that the ethanol extract of antrodia cinnamomea could be a novel anticancer agent in the armamentarium of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer management.

Kaplan-Meier method and life tables were used to estimate overall survival time over a retrospective cohort of 125 breast cancer patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog?a (INCan) during 2007-2015, who presented metastasis to the CNS as the first site of extension of the disease. The cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the prognosis factors. The median overall survival time was 14.2 months (IC95%: 11.83-26.93). Patients with triple negative (TN), according to inmunohistochemistry analysis classification, had lower survival times (p=0.0004) and had a risk of dying two times (p=0.037) higher than patients with a different immunophenotype (HR: 2.77. 95%CI: 1.10-6.99). The degree of intermediate SBR increases the risk of dying in patients with metastasis (HR 2.76, 95% CI: 1.17-6.51). CNS metastasis continues to be a poor prognostic factor that reduces survival and affects quality of life.

A purposive sample of 209 young breast-cancer survivors (mean age 39.9) was recruited for a cross-sectional survey, and the data were collected between June and October 2015. The instruments used in this study were the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Cancer Coping Questionnaire. The collected data were then analyzed using the SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0 programs. Symptom distress was found to have a significant indirect effect on coping (beta=-.32, p=.002), but not a significant direct effect (beta=.06, p=.577). Additionally, based on the values obtained for the squared multiple correlation, symptom distress, social support, and resilience were found to explain 46.4% of the total variance of coping. Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that in order to enhance young breast cancer survivors' ability to cope with the distress they commonly feel, intervention methods that strengthen resilience and provide social support should be developed and made available to them.",breast_neoplasms
29728843,"Advanced imaging can inform prognosis and may be a mechanism to de-escalate unnecessary end-of-life care in patients with cancer. Associations between greater use of advanced imaging and less-aggressive end-of-life care in real-world practice has not been examined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of SEER-Medicare data on patients who died from breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2002 and 2007. Hospital referral region (HRR)-level use of computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography was categorized by tertile of imaging use and correlated with hospice enrollment overall and late hospice enrollment using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 55,058 patients met study criteria. Hospice use ranged from 50.8% (colorectal cancer) to 62.1% (prostate cancer). In multivariable analyses, hospital referral regions (HRRs) with high rates of CT imaging were associated with lower odds of hospice enrollment (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) and late enrollment among those who did enroll (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26-1.76). HRRs with the highest rates of CT use were predominantly located in the Midwest and Northeast and associated with higher percentage population of black patients (14.5 vs 5.6%), greater comorbidity (28.4 vs 23.7%), metropolitan residence (93.9 vs 78.5%), and less than high school education (26.4 vs 19.3%). In this population-based retrospective study, we did not observe evidence that overall and timely hospice are associated with higher rates of imaging near the end of life. An observed association between higher rates of imaging, particularly CT, may be explained in part by HRR-level differences in practice patterns and patient demographic characteristics. Further research is warranted to explore the ability of oncologic imaging to appropriately de-escalate care.",breast_neoplasms

The Missouri Cancer Registry wanted to produce data that would be of interest to lawmakers as well as public health officials at the legislative district level on breast cancer, the most common non-skin cancer among females. The aim was to measure and interactively visualize survival data of female breast cancer cases in the Missouri Cancer Registry. Female breast cancer data were linked to Missouri death records and the Social Security Death Index. Unlinked female breast cancer cases were crossmatched to the National Death Index. Female breast cancer cases in subcounty senate districts were geocoded using TIGER/Line shapefiles to identify their district. A database was created and analyzed in SEER*Stat. Senatorial district maps were created using US Census Bureau's cartographic boundary files. The results were loaded with the cartographic data into InstantAtlas software to produce interactive mapping reports. Female breast cancer survival profiles of 5-year cause-specific survival percentages and 95% confidence intervals, displayed in tables and interactive maps, were created for all 34 senatorial districts.

After a diagnosis of ADH on biopsy a proportion are upgraded to carcinoma upon excision; however, the remainder of patients are overtreated. While ADH is considered a non-obligate precursor of invasive carcinoma, the molecular taxonomy remains unknown. Although a few studies have revealed some of the key genomic characteristics of ADH, a clear understanding of the molecular changes associated with breast cancer progression has been limited by inadequately powered studies and low resolution methodology. Complicating factors such as family history, and whether the ADH present in a biopsy is an isolated lesion or part of a greater neoplastic process beyond the limited biopsy material, make accurate interpretation of genomic features and their impact on progression to malignancy a challenging task. This article will review the definitions and variable management of the patients diagnosed with ADH as well as the current knowledge of the molecular landscape of ADH and its clonal relationship with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma.

The medical records of 297 postmenopausal women with luminal-type node-negative BC who underwent lumbar-spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with BMD measurement before surgery, were analyzed and compared with those of 297 age-matched randomly selected healthy controls. The correlations between women's reproductive history, including the age at menarche and menopause, parity, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, the results of DXA, and BC risk were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, 168 (28.3%) women had osteoporosis and/or osteopenia (low BMD). Both bone alterations were protective factors for BC, especially when they were considered together (p=0.001). Only the interval between menarche and menopause (MMI), dichotomized at 37.5 years as an optimal cut-off, and the HRT use reached a statistical significance (p<0.01) as risk factors. The three parameters were independent because they remained significant in the stepwise logistic regression analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) obtained with the model was 0.694 (95%CI=0.694-0.731).

This retrospective cohort study comprised 52 eribulin-treated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients. Cancer tissue samples were obtained before and after treatment in 10 patients. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine programmed death (PD)-1, CD8, and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression by stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and PD-ligand (L1) and PD-L2 expression by cancer cells. Of the 10 patients, 5 were responders (partial response) and 5 were non-responders (stable disease, 2; progressive disease, 3) to eribulin. PD-1, PD-L2, and FOXP3 expression became negative in 5 patients, PD-L1 expression became negative in 6 patients, and CD8 expression became positive in 3 patients after treatment. The response to eribulin was significantly associated with PD-L1 and FOXP3 negative conversion (p=0.024 and 0.004, respectively). The change in E-cadherin expression (positive or negative) was also correlated with the changes in PD-L1 and FOXP3 (p=0.024 and 0.004, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank tests revealed that progression-free survival and time-to-treatment failure were significantly longer in patients with PD-L1 and FOXP3 negative conversion (p=0.012 and 0.001; p=0.049 and 0.018, respectively). The efficacy of eribulin may be attributed to its biological effects on the immune system (reduction of PD-L1 and FOXP3 expression) through epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppression, and vascular remodeling and improvement of the tumor microenvironment.",breast_neoplasms

Forty-eight Isa Brown laying hens (26-week-old) were fed a fortified (0.75% CLA) or a control diet (0% CLA) for 4 months. Collected eggs were used to obtain CLA-enriched (EFA-CLA) or non-enriched (EFA) fatty acid extracts for the treatment of the MCF-7 cancer cell line. Protein levels were analysed by PathScan¢ç Stress and Apoptosis Signalling Antibody Array and western blot method. Treatment with EFA-CLA led to activation of caspase signalling as main effector of apoptosis. It also increased levels of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins as well as promoted the release of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase and mitochondrial serine protease from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. EFA-CLA increased levels of tumour protein 53 and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 tumour suppressors, and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase proteins.

Apoptosis and cell signaling proteins were evaluated in response to trastuzumab with and without BKM120, a pan-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, using western blot analysis of four breast cancer cell lines with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification. Increased expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was observed only in 3D-cultured PIK3CA-wt lines in response to trastuzumab, but not in 2D-cultured PIK3CA-wt or PIK3CA-mt lines. Decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated (p-)AKT to AKT in response to trastuzumab was more profound in PIK3CA-wt cells than in PIK3CA-mt cells in 3D culture, while the difference between PIK3CA genotypes was less apparent in 2D culture. Treatment with BKM120 and trastuzumab resulted in a stronger increase in cleaved PARP than either treatment alone. 3D Culture appears to better represent trastuzumab-induced apoptosis and resistance to trastuzumab associated with PIK3CA mutation.",breast_neoplasms

Considering that meningioma shows greater tumor growth during pregnancy, can express estrogen receptors and proliferate in response to estrogenic stimulation, the hypothesis that this type of tumor may share molecular mechanisms that involve exposure to estrogen should be investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the BRCA1 gene methylation profile in meningioma. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed on 50 meningioma samples from male and female patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using Fisher's exact test. The most important finding of this study was that 100% of the male patients over 55 years with meningioma showed BRCA1 methylated in their tumor cells. The silencing of BRCA1 through hypermethylation seems to play an important role in meningioma.",breast_neoplasms

PLUS, expression of apoptosis and TRAIL pathway proteins via western blot and cell surface expression of TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) via FACS analysis. TRAIL and ATRA evoked synergistic inhibition of breast cancer cell viability based on cytostatic and cytotoxic mechanisms. This correlated with augmented fragmentation of nuclear DNA, up-regulation of TRAIL receptor, down-regulation of cyclin D1 and enhancement of caspase activity.

This study examines perioperative and oncologic outcomes of patients with malignant spinal tumors who underwent resection with intraoperative phosphorous-32 (P32) brachytherapy. Consecutive adult patients who underwent P32 brachytherapy during malignant spinal tumor resection were retrospectively identified from 2014 to 2015. Complications, tumor recurrence, and survival were reviewed. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed. A total of 8 patients were included. Average age was 54.3 years, and 25.0% were males. Tumor types included metastatic leiomyosarcoma, chordoma, multifocal recurrent ependymomas, breast metastasis, malignant meningioma, and myxofibrosarcoma. One-half of patients underwent en bloc tumor resection. P32 plaques were applied to 2 sites per patient for mean 13.1 minutes per site with a goal penetration of 10 Gy to 1-mm depth. Perioperative complications occurred in 3 patients (37.5%), including a persistent cerebral spinal fluid leak, deep infection requiring reoperation, and sacral insufficiency fracture. At a mean 25.6 months follow-up, local recurrence rate was 25.0%, and overall survival was 75.0%. Mean time to recurrence was 14.4 months. Survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 100.0%, 100.0%, 85.7%, and 71.4%, respectively. The use of P32 is safe and feasible.

Preclinical studies suggest that lifestyle modifications may exert favorable effects on tumor biology. Randomized controlled trials in the presurgical setting serve as an ideal means to translate this research to humans; however, little is known about the characteristics of patients who enroll in these presurgical trials versus those who do not. Screening databases from three presurgical lifestyle intervention trials for breast and prostate cancer patients conducted at Duke University Medical Center (NCT00049309) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (NCT02224807 and NCT01886677) were combined for analysis. Demographic and anthropometric differences between enrolled vs. non-enrolled individuals were assessed using Chi-square for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. There was no difference in participation rate when comparing minority status or overweight and obese patients. However, obese females were slightly more likely to enroll than women who were overweight (p?=?0.110), a trend not seen in men. Women were also less likely than men to participate if their study site was >25 miles from their home (p?=?0.034). Patients who had completed a college degree were somewhat less likely to enroll than those with less educational attainment (p?=?0.072). Of those who did not enroll, 80% cited a lack of time.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the change in total physical activity level and occupational, sport and household activity levels of breast cancer survivors from preoperatively up to 24 months after breast cancer surgery. Additionally, predictive factors for this change were investigated. Patients with primary breast cancer (n?=?267) filled in the Flemish Physical Activity Computerized Questionnaire (FPACQ) before surgery and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors were analyzed as predictive factors for change in physical activity. Two years after surgery, all activity levels (total, occupational, sport and household) were still significantly lower compared to preoperative values. After the first 12 months, no significant improvements were seen for none of the activity levels, except for the occupational activity. Two years after breast cancer surgery, physical activity levels are still significantly lower compared to pre-operative values. Based on this limited recovery, it seems important to monitor physical activity levels in breast cancer patients and advice these patients to stay active after surgery and return to pre-operative activity levels in the long term as well.

29655462,"Neoplasms exhibits a high incidence and mortality rates due to their complex and commonly overlapping clinical, biochemical, and morphologic profiles influenced by acquired or inherited molecular abnormalities, cell of origin, and level of differentiation. Obesity appears related to ~20% of cancers including endometrial, esophageal, colorectal, postmenopausal breast, prostate, and renal. Several factors other than obesity, i.e., insulin, insulin-like growth factor, sexual hormones, and adipokines may play a potential role in neoplasia. Cancer-associated hypercoagulable and thrombotic states are influenced by abnormalities in the vascular wall and susceptibility to invasion, interference in blood flow and increase in circulating tissue factor and thrombin, activation of cell growth factors, the presence of a central catheter, chemotherapies, neoplasm type, and surgery. In cancer, thromboembolic complications are the second most frequent cause of death with pulmonary thromboembolism in ~50% of cases postmortem. Thrombosis worsens prognosis as demonstrated with a survival rate as low as 12% per year vs 36% in nonthrombic patients. Deep vein thrombosis is the most frequent thromboembolic complication in cancer. It is usually detected at diagnosis and within the first 3 months of chemotherapy. The underlining mechanisms of this association should be further studied to identify patients at higher risk and develop adequate prevention, diagnostic, and treatment measures. The D-dimer test can be successfully used to assess the fibrinolytic phase of coagulation and as such is routinely used in suspected cases of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. In addition, significant advances have been made in understanding the composition and functional capabilities of the gut microbiota in the inflammatory process, obesity, and its roles in cancer; however, the intricate balance that exists within the microbiota may not only affect the host directly, it can also disrupt the entire microbial community. Cancer is a prothrombotic and inflammatory state in which the activation of coagulation is related to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. It is important to identify the relationship between body mass index with these processes and clarify their importance in cancer prognosis. Future research should answer the question if manipulation of resident microbial communities could potentially improve prognosis and treatment outcome.",breast_neoplasms

The tumor composed of epithelial -myoepithelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was not reported previously. An 81-year-old woman presented with a palpable nodule in the left breast for 4 days. The ultrasonography showed multinodular growth and focally indistinct borders. Owing to her advanced age and possible early clinical staging, primary tumor resection was performed. One year later, a small and slow growing subcutaneous nodule was found under the incision of the left breast. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular, cystic and solid, hypoechoic mass with circumscribed borders. Microscopic examination of the primary tumor revealed epithelial -myoepithelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The former had a variety of architecture patterns, including nests, lobulations, papillary and tubular structures, and the latter showed varying morphological features, from squamous pearls to spindle cells. The recurrent tumor showed only epithelial -myoepithelial carcinoma with more aggressively malignant features than those seen in the primary tumor. An extensive resection of the left breast mass was performed for the recurrent tumor. The patient did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy because of the patient's advanced age.

The neoplasms were the third cause of hospital discharges for immigrants and the seventh one for Chileans. The adjusted rate of cancer hospital discharges was higher for Chileans than immigrants, and the latter had fewer days of hospitalization and greater proportion of surgical interventions. In the group of immigrants, cancer hospital discharges mainly corresponded to patients belonging to the private system (46%), and in the group of Chileans they mainly corresponded to patients in the public system (71.1%). We observed a large difference in the proportion of cancer hospital discharges for patients with no health insurance between the two populations (22.6%: immigrants, 1.0%: Chileans). In both populations, the three most frequent types of cancer were: (i) lymphoid tissue, hematopoietic organs, and related tissues, (ii) digestive organs, and (iii) breast cancer.

This study was performed to evaluate the rate of upgrading to malignancy or high-risk lesions after excision and to identify factors associated with upgrading using a large series of benign IDP cases without atypia. We included patients who were diagnosed as having benign IDP without atypia on CNB and underwent surgical or vacuum-assisted excision between 2010 and 2015. We analyzed the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of IDPs that were upgraded to malignancy or high-risk lesions after excision. A total of 511 benign IDPs without atypia diagnosed via CNB were identified, of which 398 cases were treated with excision. After reviewing these cases, four cases of high-risk lesions in adjacent tissue on CNB, two cases which were revealed as papilloma with atypia, and nine cases of malignancy in the same breast were excluded. In the remaining 383 cases, the rate of upgrading to malignancy and high-risk lesions after excision was 0.8% and 4.4%, respectively. The presence of concurrent contralateral breast cancer, the presence of symptoms, and multifocality were factors significantly associated with upgrading to malignancy on subsequent excision. Surgical excision rather than vacuum-assisted excision was significantly associated with upgrading to high-risk lesions or malignancy. The rate of upgrading to malignancy for benign IDP without atypia was very low, suggesting that close clinical and radiologic observation may be sufficient for patients with benign IDP without atypia on CNB under proper settings.",breast_neoplasms

Therefore, we analyzed the characteristics and prognosis of patients with breast cancer with multiple primary cancers (MPCs). Data from the Korean Breast Cancer Society Registry were analyzed. Data from enrolled patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer were analyzed for differences in prognosis dependent on the presence of MPCs, and which MPC characteristics affected their prognosis. Among the 41,841 patients analyzed, 913 patients were found to have MPCs, accounting for 950 total MPCs. There was a significant difference in survival rates between the breast cancer only group and the MPC group. The 5-year survival rates were 93.6% and 86.7% and the 10-year survival rates were 87.5% and 70.4%, respectively. Among the 913 patients with MPCs, patients with two or more MPCs had significantly worse prognoses than patients with a single MPC. With respect to the time interval between breast cancer and MPC occurrence, patients with a 5-year or greater interval had significantly better prognoses than patients with less than 1 year between occurrences. Among MPCs, thyroid cancer was the most common primary cancer. However, this type was not related to the prognosis of breast cancer. Gynecologic cancer, colorectal cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer were related to breast cancer prognosis. MPCs were a poor prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer.

Here, we report a study of the regulation of the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway by a small molecule, isomangiferin. in vitro. In vitro, isomangiferin treatment inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion. The effect of isomangiferin on breast cancer growth was well coordinated with its suppression of angiogenesis. A rat aortic ring assay revealed that isomangiferin significantly inhibited blood vessel formation during VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting. Furthermore, isomangiferin treatment inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the formation of capillary-like structures. Mechanistically, isomangiferin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, VEGF-induced activation of the VEGFR-2 kinase pathway was down-regulated by isomangiferin.

29599331,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been suggested to play an important role in survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and tumorigenesis of many cell types. Breast cancer patients with high EGFR expression have a poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of isochlorogenic acid c (ICAC) extracted from Lonicera japonica on elevated EGFR levels of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231. The cell viability and cell-cycle analysis were evaluated using 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The migration ability and invasiveness of ICAC-treated MDA-MB-231 were examined by migration and Matrigel invasion assay. The epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-related protein expression was examined by western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ICAC led to significant morphological changes and suppressed migration and invasion capacities of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot analysis for EGFR/EMT-associated proteins suggested that ICAC attenuated the mesenchymal traits as observed by up-regulation of epithelial markers and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers as well as decreased activities of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of ICAC against EGFR-induced EMT and MDA-MB-231 cell invasion were dependent on the EGFR/ phospholipase C¥ã (PLC¥ã)/extracellular regulated protein kinase ¨ö (ERK¨ö)/slug signaling pathway. Therefore, the obtained results could provide us clues for the next therapeutic strategy in the treatment of TNBC.",breast_neoplasms

Aberrant expression of piRNA and PIWI proteins have been identified in various types of tumour cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression profiles of PIWI-like protein-1, -2 (PIWIL1 and PIWIL2), their immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics in ductal breast cancer, and determine their correlation with clinicopathological parameters of this type of cancer. Material for IHC studies comprised of 101 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases and 31 mastopathy tissues. Frozen fragments of paired tissue specimens (tumour and adjacent non-malignant breast tissue) taken from 55 patients with IDC and 18 samples of mastopathy were used for molecular studies using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A statistically significantly higher level of PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 was found in IDC compared to mastopathy samples (p¡Â0.0001). Increased expression of PIWIL1 was correlated with increased PIWIL2 expression in breast cancer tissue. Surprisingly, PIWIL1 mRNA was detected only in cancer and mastopathy, but was not found in most normal breast tissues, although it is noteworthy that the PIWIL2 mRNA level was statistically significantly lower in mastopathy and IDC samples compared to normal breast tissues.

This study aimed to derive utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancer in China. An interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted in 12 provinces across China from 2013 to 2014. The three-level EuroQol-5-Dimension instrument was used to evaluate quality of life, and utility scores were generated using the Chinese value set. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the determinants of utility scores. In total, 2626 breast cancer and 471 precancer patients were included. Mean age was 49.1 for breast cancer and 41.4 years for precancer (p?<?0.001). Among the five dimensions, pain/discomfort was the most reported problem, 53.9% in breast cancer and 29.3% in precancer patients. Mean (95% CI) utility scores for breast cancer and precancer patients were estimated as 0.887 (0.875-0.899) and 0.781 (0.774-0.788), and the scores of breast cancer at stage-I, stage-II, stage-III and stage-IV were 0.789 (0.774-0.805), 0.793 (0.783-0.802), 0.774 (0.759-0.788) and 0.686 (0.654-0.717), respectively.

Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Invasive lobular carcinoma of breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2, were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric cancer originating from breast. Right breast conserving surgery was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Forty-one months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies without new metastatic lesions.

The reference lists given in the identified RCTs were also reviewed to identify potentially relevant studies. Six RCTs involving 373 patients were included. The change in short- and long-term CRF (SCRF and LCRF, respectively) was calculated as the change in the mean score for CRF from baseline to the end of intervention period and to the end of post-intervention follow-up, respectively. Pooled results suggested that Tai Chi had a significant positive effect on standard mean difference (i.e., SCRF; SMD?=?-?0.54; p?<?0.0001), but the impact on LCRF remained unclear. Subgroup analyses of SCRF indicated positive effects of Tai Chi among patients with breast (SMD?=?-?0.81; p?<?0.00001) and lung cancer (SMD?=?-?0.50; p?=?0.002), but not prostate cancer (p?=?0.98).

Nanomedicine is emerging as a promising alternative technique to overcome cancer MDR. Thus, pemetrexed-loaded d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) liposomes (liposomal pemetrexed) were developed as a strategy to overcome MDR to pemetrexed in breast cancer. Liposomal pemetrexed was developed using the calcium acetate gradient method. The cytotoxic effects, apoptosis-inducing activity, in vivo distribution, and antitumor activity of liposomal pemetrexed were investigated. 50 of liposomal pemetrexed following treatment with MDR breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells overexpressing ABCC5) was 2.6-fold more effective than pemetrexed. The in vivo biodistribution study showed that the liposomes significantly accumulated in tumors 24 h after injection. The antitumor assay in mice bearing MDR breast cancer xenograft tumors confirmed the superior antitumor activity of liposomal pemetrexed over pemetrexed. It was also found that the improved therapeutic effect of liposomal pemetrexed may be attributed to apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

Therefore, studies on nanocarrier systems designed for endoglin-directed diagnostic and drug delivery purposes would expose the feasibility of targeting endoglin with therapeutics. Liposomes carrying high concentrations of a near-infrared fluorescent dye in the aqueous interior were prepared by the lipid film hydration and extrusion procedure, then conjugated to single chain antibody fragments either selective for murine endoglin (termed mEnd-IL) or directed towards human endoglin (termed hEnd-IL). A combination of Dynamic Light Scattering, electron microscopy, cell binding and uptake assays, confocal microscopy and in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice bearing xenografted human breast cancer and human fibrosarcoma models were implemented to elucidate the potentials of the liposomes. The mEnd-IL and hEnd-IL were highly selective for the respective murine- and human endoglin expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Hence, the hEnd-IL bound distinctly to the tumor cells and enabled suitable fluorescence imaging of the tumors, whereas the mEnd-IL bound the tumor vasculature, but also to the liver, kidney and lung vasculature of mice. The work highlights key differences between targeting vascular (murine) and neoplastic (human) endoglin in animal studies, and suggests that the hEnd-IL can serve as a delivery system that targets human endoglin overexpressed in pathological conditions.

29542106,"Metastatic breast cancer is not a curable disease, but women with metastatic disease are living longer. Surgery to remove the primary tumour is associated with an increased survival in other types of metastatic cancer. Breast surgery is not standard treatment for metastatic disease, however several recent retrospective studies have suggested that breast surgery could increase the women's survival. These studies have methodological limitations including selection bias. A systematic review mapping all randomised controlled trials addressing the benefits and potential harms of breast surgery is ideal to answer this question. To assess the effects of breast surgery in women with metastatic breast cancer. We conducted searches using the MeSH terms 'breast neoplasms', 'mastectomy', and 'analysis, survival' in the following databases: the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Embase (by OvidSP) on 22 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (22 February 2016) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (24 February 2016). We conducted an additional search in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference proceedings in July 2016 that included reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors to identify additional studies. The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials of women with metastatic breast cancer at initial diagnosis comparing breast surgery plus systemic therapy versus systemic therapy alone. The primary outcomes were overall survival and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (local and distant control), breast cancer-specific survival, and toxicity from local therapy. Two review authors independently conducted trial selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment (using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool), which a third review author checked. We used the GRADE tool to assess the quality of the body of evidence. We used the risk ratio (RR) to measure the effect of treatment for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event outcomes. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these measures. We used the random-effects model, as we expected clinical or methodological heterogeneity, or both, among the included studies. We included two trials enrolling 624 women in the review. It is uncertain whether breast surgery improves overall survival as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.31; 2 studies; 624 women). The two studies did not report quality of life. Breast surgery may improve local progression-free survival (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.57; 2 studies; 607 women; low-quality evidence), while it probably worsened distant progression-free survival (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.86; 1 study; 350 women; moderate-quality evidence). The two included studies did not measure breast cancer-specific survival. Toxicity from local therapy was reported by 30-day mortality and did not appear to differ between the two groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.90; 1 study; 274 women; low-quality evidence). Based on existing evidence from two randomised clinical trials, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions on the benefits and risks of breast surgery associated with systemic treatment for women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Until the ongoing clinical trials are finalised, the decision to perform breast surgery in these women should be individualised and shared between the physician and the patient considering the potential risks, benefits, and costs of each intervention.",breast_neoplasms

Tumors from five hundred and seven breast cancer patients were prospectively collected from the West China Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Whole exons of AKT1 and PIK3CA were detected in fresh-frozen tumors using next-generation sequencing, and correlations between PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations and clinicopathological features were analyzed. The AKT1 mutation was found in 3.6% (18/507) of patients. Tumors from patients that carried the AKT1 mutation were estrogen receptor (ER)+/progesterone receptor (PR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)? and were more likely to have high expression levels of Ki67. The prevalence of the PIK3CA mutation was 46.5% (236/507), and 35 patients carried two or three variants of the PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA mutations were associated with ER+/PR+/HER2? status. The prognosis of patients with one mutation in PIK3CA (or PIK3CA/AKT1) was not significantly different than that of patients with wild-type PIK3CA (or PIK3CA/AKT1), while patients with two or three variants in PIK3CA (or PIK3CA/AKT1) exhibited poorer outcomes in the entire group and in all three subgroups (ER+, HER2?, Ki67 high), particularly with respect to overall survival. A high frequency of somatic PIK3CA mutations was detected in Chinese breast cancer patients.

Higher level of depression, financial difficulty and physical fatigue, more breast symptoms, and poorer global health status were independently associated with poorer workability. Lower employment and reduced workability in breast cancer survivors is common, and reduced workability is associated with higher levels of depression, financial difficulty and physical fatigue, more breast symptoms, and poorer global health status.

Although the roles of IP in other cancers, and inflammatory diseases have been extensively studied, its significance in breast cancer is unclear. We investigated the expression of LMP7, an IP subunit, and its relationship with immune system components in two breast cancer cohorts. In 668 consecutive breast cancer cohort, 40% of tumors showed high level of LMP7 expression, and tumors with high expression of LMP7 had more tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in each subtype of breast cancer. In another cohort of 681 triple-negative breast cancer patients cohort, the expression of LMP7 in tumor cells was significantly correlated with the amount of TILs and the expression of interferon-associated molecules (MxA [p < 0.001] and PKR [p < 0.001]), endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated molecules (PERK [p=0.012], p-eIF2a [p=0.001], and XBP1 [p < 0.001]), and damage-associated molecular patterns (HMGN1 [p < 0.001] and HMGB1 [p < 0.001]). Patients with higher LMP7 expression had better disease-free survival outcomes than those with no or low expression in the positive lymph node metastasis group (p=0.041). Close association between the TIL levels and LMP7 expression in breast cancer indicates that better antigen presentation through greater LMP7 expression might be associated with more TILs.",breast_neoplasms

A GCT is a rare, benign, hyperplasia-based lesion. Approximately 1% to 2% of GCTs are malignant. About 5% to15% of the cases occur in the breast, and it is relatively rare in the axillary accessory breast. There are no effective preventive measures for GCTs, early detection combined with a thorough and wide complete resection of the tumor remains the best treatment for a favorable outcome. A 45-year-old female patient with an axillary mass of more than 3 months duration was examined through physical examination, color Doppler ultrasound and postoperative pathology. A provisional diagnosis of left axillary lymph node enlargement was made and necessary investigations were advised.

Data from 21,527 patients with primary breast cancer were collected retrospectively in a single cancer centre; 4.1% of the women developed a second non-breast cancer. The most frequently observed second primary tumor affected the digestive tract (27.8%). The frequency of observed cancers was similar to that expected in the general population, excepting for an excess of melanoma [SIR 1.98 (1.52-2.53)], uterine cancers [SIR 1.44 (1.17-1.74)], ovarian cancers [SIR 1.67 (1.31-2.10)], thyroid tumors [SIR 1.54 (1.23-1.92)], and leukemia [SIR 1.57 (1.11-2.16)]. Clinicopathological breast cancer stratification showed a general increased risk of developing a second cancer in older patients, excluding ovarian cancer. An increased risk of developing ovarian cancer after breast cancer diagnosis was observed, in particular, in triple-negative [HR 3.47 (1.91-6.29)], G3 tumors [HR 2.54 (1.10-5.83)] and in positive breast cancer family history [HR 2.19 (1.22-3.94)]. Breast cancer survivors in hormonal therapy treatment are at higher risk for developing a second thyroid cancer [HR 4.00 (1.46-10.9)]. Conversely, adjuvant chemotherapy offered a protective effect on thyroid cancer risk development [HR 0.46 (0.28-0.76)]. Older age represents the major risk of developing a second primary non-breast cancer, excluding ovarian cancer.

29495008,"Breast cancer is a common cause of cancer mortality throughout the world. The cross-talk between cancer cells and interstitial cells exerts significant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and is modulated in part by chemokines. CXC is one of four chemokine families involved in mediating survival, angiogenesis, and immunosensitization by chemoattracting leukocytes, and it incentivizes tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. However, the differential expression profiles and prognostic values of these chemokines remains to be elucidated. In this study, we compared transcriptional CXC chemokines and survival data of patients with breast carcinoma (BC) using the ONCOMINE dataset, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TCGA and cBioPortal. We discovered increased mRNA levels for CXCL8/10/11/16/17, whereas mRNA expression of CXCL1/2/3/4/5/6/7/12/14 was lower in BC patients compared to non-tumor tissues. Kaplan-Meier plots revealed that high mRNA levels of CXCL1/2/3/4/5/6/7/12/14 correlate with relapse-free survival (RFS) in all types of BC patients. Conversely, high CXCL8/10/11 predicted worse RFS in BC patients. Significantly, high transcription levels of CXCL9/12/13/14 conferred an overall survival (OS) advantage in BC patients, while high levels of CXCL8 demonstrated shorter OS in all BC sufferers. Integrative bioinformatics analysis suggests that CXCL8/12/14 are potential suitable targets for precision therapy in BC patients compared to other CXC chemokines.",breast_neoplasms
29495002,"PI3KCA and mutant p53 are associated with tumorigenesis and the development of cancers. NVP-BKM120, a selective pan-PI3K inhibitor, exerts the antitumor activity by suppressing the PI3K signaling pathway. Prima-1Met, a low molecular weight compound, can rescue the gain-of-function of mutant p53 by restoring its transcriptional function. In this study, we investigated whether PI3K inhibition combined with mutant p53 reactivation could enhance the antitumor effect in thyroid cancer cells. The effects of BKM120 and Prima-1Met on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells were measured by MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. Thyroid differentiation was assessed by detecting the expression levels of specific markers using RT-PCR and Western blot. The in vivo antitumor efficacy was analyzed in a mouse xenograft model. The combinational treatment of BKM120 and Prima-1Met significantly enhanced the inhibitions of cell viability, colony formation, migration and invasion, and the induction of apoptosis in thyroid cell lines, and synergistically suppressed tumor xenograft growth by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and EMT signaling pathways, up-regulating p53 targeted genes, and triggering the release of cytochrome c. Moreover, the combination of BKM120 and Prima-1Met suppressed the stemlike traits of thyroid cancer cells and promoted their differentiation by upregulating the expression of thyroid-specific differentiation markers and repressing the expression of cancer stem cell markers. Furthermore, the mechanism study demonstrated that the combinational treatment synergistically abrogated the binding of CPSF4 at the promoter of hTERT and thus suppressed hTERT expression. Consistently, overexpression of hTERT rescued the inhibitions of cell viability, invasion and stem-like traits mediated by the combination of BKM120 and Prima-1Met. Our results showed that the combination of BKM120 with Prima-1Met synergistically suppressed the growth of thyroid cancer cells and tumor xenografts via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CPSF4/hTERT signaling and reactivating mutant p53.",breast_neoplasms

Our group has assessed all patients with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS, a one-sheet questionnaire addressing 11 major symptoms and wellbeing on a numeric scale of 0-10) before palliative radiotherapy (PRT) since 2012. Therefore, we were able to analyze the prognostic impact of baseline ESAS symptom severity. We performed a retrospective review of 102 patients treated with PRT between 2012 and 2015. All ESAS items were analyzed by two different methods, dichotomized by median score and by score <4 vs. ¡Ã4. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for survival, and from these a 4-tiered score was developed. The most common tumor types were prostate, breast and non-small cell lung cancer, predominantly with distant metastases. Despite differences between the two methods of ESAS data handling, the final multivariable models were strikingly similar. Therefore, the better reproducible cut-off was chosen, i.e. a score ¡Ã4. Multivariable analyses resulted in 4 significant prognostic factors, which contributed equally to the 4-tiered survival score (performance status, more than one cancer diagnosis, progressive disease outside the PRT target volume(s), ESAS appetite).

This study included 18,528 patients with invasive breast cancer. Data on additional ML-I treatments were reported for 164 patients. We developed a ""similar case"" method with a distance measure retrieved from the beta variable in Cox regression to compare these patients, after stage adjustment, with their non-ML-1 treated counterparts in order to answer three hypotheses concerning overall survival, recurrence free survival and life quality. Raw data analysis of an additional ML-I treatment yielded a worse outcome (p=0.02) for patients with ML treatment, possibly due to a bias inherent in the ML-I-treated patients. Using the ""similar case"" method (a case-based reasoning approach) we could not confirm this harm for patients using ML-I. Analysis of life quality data did not demonstrate reliable differences between patients treated with ML-I treatment and those without proven ML-I treatment.

Secondarily, changes in Hsp70/Hsp90 expression in the continuum of breast neoplasia were assessed. Hsp70/Hsp90 expression was approached globally, quantified by means of immunohistochemistry, western blot or PCR. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant studies were sought in PubMed, up to December 31, 2015. A total of 23 eligible studies were identified (7,288 breast cancer cases). High Hsp90 expre s sion was associated with worse overall survival (pooled RR=1.48, 95%CI=1.21-1.82) and marginally with worse disease-free survival. High Hsp70 expression also correlated with worse disease-free survival (pooled RR=1.77, 95%CI=1.71-2.82). Hsp70 intense expression correlated with ER positivity (pooled OR=3.51, 95%CI=1.31-9.40) and PR positivity (pooled OR=2.48, 95%CI=1.39-4.44). No significant associations were noted between Hsp70/Hsp90 expression and clinicopathological variables including histological grade, tumor size, nodal metastasis or patient age at diagnosis.

Subjects were aged 25-89 (median 55) years when they underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy to the entire breast (60-68Gray) between 1992 and 2001. Additional treatment included hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics. SMNs were grouped by site. The rate of SMNs over time was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. To compare the probability of developing SMNs overall and for specific organs or sites, probability estimates were obtained for a 55-year-old female from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER). Median follow-up from radiotherapy was 13.8?years. The 15-year age-adjusted probability of developing any SMN was 12.0%, close to the SEER rate of 12.1% for a non-breast malignancy. Systemic therapy and higher-dose radiotherapy (>?63?Gray) were not associated with significantly increased risks of SMNs. Compared to SEER, significantly increased risk was noted for gynecologic cancers and melanoma. Most SMNs were unrelated to treatment, and the 15-year incidence was similar to that of cancer in the SEER control group-findings that should be reassuring to patients.

Survey respondents were randomized to one of two surveys, presenting risk either as percentages only or as icon arrays and percentages. Respondents were required to choose between two hypothetical NBSPs or no screening in 11 choice sets generated using a Bayesian D-efficient design. The trade-offs women made were analyzed using heteroskedastic conditional logit and scale-adjusted latent class models. A total of 1018 women completed the discrete choice experiment (percentages-only version = 507; icon arrays and percentages version = 511).

To study GATA3 expression in a series of 14 primary cutaneous cribriform carcinomas and to test its usefulness to differentiate this tumor from metastatic breast cancer. We retrieved 14 cases with PCACC (each from a different patient) from the files of the authors. Cases were dated from 1994 to 2014. We also evaluated 6 cases of cutaneous breast cancer metastasis RESULTS: No PCACCs expressed GATA3. Breast cancer metastases expressed GATA3 in 100% of our studied cases. Even though GATA3 expression has been reported in many benign and malignant adnexal tumors (mostly of sebaceous, follicular, and apocrine differentiation), as well as in many other neoplasms, GATA3 staining to differentiate PCACC from skin breast cancer metastasis has a high negative predictive value. A positive GATA3 staining in this context should permit one to rule out PCACC with a high level of confidence.",breast_neoplasms
29428030,"Time interval (TI) from breast cancer diagnosis to definitive surgery is increasing, but the impact on outcomes is not well understood. TI longer than 30 days is associated with a greater chance of delay of chemotherapy, which may impact survival. We sought to identify factors associated with longer TI and the influence on outcome measures. We examined TI for stage 0-III breast cancer patients treated between 2006 and 2015 at a university-based cancer center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to study factors associated with TI <30, 30 to 60, and >60 days. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to examine the effect of different TI on overall survival, disease-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival. 1589 patients were included with a median follow-up of 47 months. Median TI was 32 days. Median TI increased in patients from 2011 to 2015 compared with those from 2006 to 2010 (35 vs 30 days, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, mastectomy (with or without reconstruction), MRI use, and increasing age were independent predictors of TI >30 days . There were no significant differences in overall survival, disease-specific survival, or recurrence-free survival. There was no association between TI >30 days and a subsequent delay >60 days to adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.72-1.52). TI has increased in the last five years. Patient characteristics, tumor biology, and stage do not influence TI, whereas age, mastectomy, and MRI use were all associated with longer TI. Longer TI does not appear to significantly delay adjuvant chemotherapy or influence short-term outcomes.",breast_neoplasms

A set of 261 female patients with invasive breast cancer, pre-operative dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) images and available ODX score at our institution was identified. A computer algorithm extracted a comprehensive set of 529 features from the DCE-MR images of these patients. The set of patients was divided into a training set and a test set. Using the training set we developed two machine learning-based models to discriminate (1) high ODX scores from intermediate and low ODX scores, and (2) high and intermediate ODX scores from low ODX scores. The performance of these models was evaluated on the independent test set. High against low and intermediate ODX scores were predicted by the multivariate model with AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.56-0.98, p?<?0.003). Low against intermediate and high ODX score was predicted with AUC 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.61, p?=?0.75). A moderate association between imaging and ODX score was identified.

29414807,"Tropomyosin-2 (TPM2) plays important roles in functions of the cytoskeleton, such as cytokinesis, vesicle transport, cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis,and these functions imply that TPM2 also plays a role in cancer development. Indeed, it has been shown that TPM2 plays a critical role in some cancers. However, the role of TPM2 in breast cancer is still poorly characterized. Thus, we explored the role of TPM2 in breast cancer. We analysed TPM2 expression and its correlation with the clinicopathological features in breast cancer. Then, we examined the influence of hypoxia on TPM2 expression and methylation status using bisulfite sequencing PCR. Furthermore, we performed TPM2-mediated migration and invasion assays in the context of hypoxia and examined changes in matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) expression. Finally, we detected the influence of TPM2 on survival and chemotherapy drug sensitivity. We found that TPM2 expression is down-regulated in breast cancer cells compared to that in normal breast cells. The data from TCGA supported these results. Promoter methylation of TPM2, which could be induced by hypoxia, was responsible for its low expression. Hypoxia might regulate cell invasiveness partly by TPM2 down-regulation-mediated changes of MMP2 expression. Importantly, low TPM2 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.031), tumour node metastasis stage (P=0.01), histological grade (P=0.037), and shorter overall survival (P=0.028). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that TPM2 was an independent predictor in breast cancer patients. Paclitaxel chemotherapy did not benefit patients with low TPM2 expression (P<0.0001). TPM2 knockdown significantly reduced cell sensitivity to paclitaxel. TPM2 is a potential novel tumour suppressor gene in breast cancer. TPM2 is associated with poor survival and chemoresistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer, and TPM2 may represent a promising therapeutic gene target for breast cancer patients with chemoresistance.",breast_neoplasms

Medical records were reviewed for surgical outcomes and follow-up imaging. Eight hundred and ninety-three patients with 900 biopsy-proven HRLs underwent surgical excision (97.0% [873 of 900]) or had at least 2 years of imaging follow-up (3.0% [27 of 900]). The most common HRL was atypical ductal hyperplasia in the DM and DBT groups (37.4% [337 of 900]). The overall upgrade rate of HRLs to malignancy was 11.3% (102 of 900). There were no statistically significant differences in overall upgrades rates of HRLs on DM vs DBT (11.4% [54 of 475] vs 11.3% [48 of 425]; p?= 0.97) or in upgrade rates of HRL subtypes. However, HRLs that upgraded on DBT were more likely to be invasive rather than in situ carcinoma compared with HRLs that upgraded on DM (39.6% [19 of 48] vs 20.4% [11 of 54]; p?= 0.03). Overall, the most common HRL to upgrade was atypical ductal hyperplasia (18.4% [62 of 337]). The least common HRLs to upgrade in the DBT group were biphasic neoplasms (0% [0 of 22]), flat epithelial atypia (1.6% [1 of 62]), and papillomas without atypia (4.5% [2?of?44]).

To further explain the association between OCA2 SNPs and breast cancer survival, we investigated the predictive value of rs4778137 located in OCA2 in local advanced breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A case-cohort with 150 breast cancer patients was performed to evaluate the effects of the OCA2 rs4778137 on breast cancer survival. The association between rs4778137 genotypes and pathological complete response (pCR, defined that the postoperative pathology indicating no residual invasive breast cancer in the breast or the axillary lymph node) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors of pCR. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis according to the rs4778137 genotypes. The differences between pCR and the rs4778137 genotypes were statistically significant (p?<?0.05). The patients with genotype GG harbored a better disease-free survival (HR: 2.358, p?=?0.000) and overall survival (HR: 1.578, p?=?0.008) than the patients with genotype CC in rs4778137.

Surgical intervention can be performed via the traditional open surgery (OS) approach or the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach. This study aims to assess the available evidence of perioperative outcomes of MIS versus OS for patients with metastatic spinal disease. We followed recommended PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Six electronic databases were searched to identify all potentially relevant studies published from inception to October 2017. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions. Six studies satisfied the criteria for inclusion into this study. There were 292 patients with metastatic spinal disease described in the cohort, treated with either MIS (n?= 155, 53%) or OS (n?= 137, 47%). Compared with OS, MIS resulted in statistically significant reduction in blood loss (mean difference,?-601.48 mL; P < 0.001) and length of stay (mean difference,?-4.60 days; P?= 0.002). In terms of complications, MIS had a significantly reduced incidence compared with OS (21/155 [14%] and 37/136 [27%], respectively; odds ratio, 0.41; P?= 0.005). In terms of operation duration (P?= 0.43), postoperative functional (P?= 0.76) and pain (P?= 0.84) outcomes, MIS was noninferior to OS. Surgical intervention by an MIS approach in patients with metastatic spinal disease seems to provide equivalent outcomes compared with OS and reduces morbidity and length of stay.

In this prospective study, we investigated direct electron field, in terms of optimal coverage of tumour bed volume following localization using ultrasound and surgical clips. First, for all 24 patients, a breast sonographer drew perimeter of tumour bed on the breast skin. Then an electron boost field was outlined on the demarcated territory, and a lead wire marker compatible with CT scan was placed on the field borders by a 2cm margin. After CT scan simulation, all patients underwent adjuvant whole breast irradiation with 3D-conformal radiotherapy to 50Gy in 25 fractions. Then for boost radiotherapy, lead wire in CT images was countoured as electron boost field. Also, the tumour bed was contoured based on surgical clips (true clinical target volume and true planning target volume). Electron treatment planning was done for electron boost field. Finally isodose coverages for true planning target volume investigated. On average, 16.68% of clips planning target volume (true planning target volume; range: 0.00 to 95%) received 90% oor more of the prescribed dose when the electron treatment plan was made. Isodose curves does not provide adequate coverage on the tumour bed (clips planning target volume) when electron boost treatment planning was generated for electron boost field (en face electron field). In fact, a part of target (planning target volume-c) is missed and more doses is absorbed in normal tissue.

We examined tumoral Del-1 expression and analyzed its prognostic impact among patients with EBC. Del-1 mRNA expression was assessed in breast epithelial and cancer cells. Meanwhile, the tumoral expression of Del-1 was determined based on tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry results from 440 patients. While a high Del-1 mRNA expression was found in all the breast cancer cell lines, the expression was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231. Tumoral expression of Del-1 was also significantly associated with a negative expression of estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor, and low expression of Ki-67, particularly in the case of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p < 0.036). Furthermore, a correlation was found between Del-1 expression and an aggressive histological grade, nuclear mitosis, and polymorphism, suggesting a possible role in tumor progression. In the survival analysis, a worse distant disease-free survival trend was noted for the group overexpressing Del-1. While all the investigated breast cancer cell lines exhibited Del-1 expression, the expression rate and intensity were specifically prominent in TNBC.

We retrospectively analyzed outcomes in 192 patients who underwent whole breast irradiation of 50.4 Gy followed by a median boost dose of 15.0 Gy (range, 12-16 Gy). Boost doses of 12.5 Gy and 15 Gy were delivered to patients with carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma, respectively, at the positive margins. We evaluated the impact of the boost dose on the IBTR rate. Median follow-up duration was 6.7 years (0.4-15.6 years). The 5-year cumulative risk of IBTR as a first event was 5.0%. IBTR occurred as a first recurrence in 13 of 192 patients. In-boost-field recurrences were found in 11 patients (85%). Five patients (39%) experienced out-of boost field recurrences, and three experienced both types of recurrences. In multivariate analysis, age (<40 years), pT stage, and positive radial resection margin were prognostic factors for IBTR (P = 0.029, P = 0.024 and P = 0.035, respectively). A median boost dose of 15 Gy might be insufficient in patients younger than 40 years, with tumor size greater than 2 cm, or with involved radial resection margins.

A total of 107 cases of FNA cell blocks (49 cases) and small biopsies (58 cases) were selected, including 34 melanomas, 31 epithelioid/pleomorphic sarcomas, and 42 carcinomas. IHC was performed on all specimens using a peroxidase-based brown chromogen for SOX10 and an alkaline phosphatase-based red chromogen for keratins AE1/AE3. The presence or absence of staining in lesional cells was scored. The majority of tumors demonstrated 1 of 3 distinct patterns: 1) malignant melanomas with nuclear SOX10 (sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 95%); 2) epithelioid/pleomorphic sarcomas negative for both SOX10 and AE1/AE3 (sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 88%); and 3) carcinomas with cytoplasmic AE1/AE3 (sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 98%). In addition, a fourth pattern with cytoplasmic AE1/AE3 and nuclear SOX10 was observed in a subset of carcinomas, most notably triple-negative breast cancers. SOX10/keratin dual-color IHC appears to be an effective, sensitive, and specific test to distinguish between melanoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma. This approach can identify melanoma, prioritize additional studies, and limit the number of markers needed to workup an epithelioid malignant neoplasm, thereby potentially reducing costs and preserving valuable tissue for ancillary studies with which to guide therapy.

Compared with patients undergoing APE, patients undergoing ELAPE had a significant reduced risk of no more than 3 years local recurrence (LR) (risk ratio [RR]?=?0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.08-0.94), 3-year mortality (odds ratio [OR]?=?0.45, 95% CI?=?0.20-0.97), intraoperative bowel perforation (IBP) involvement (RR?=?0.48, 95% CI?=?0.31-0.74), and circumferential resection margin (CRM) positivity (RR?=?0.66, 95% CI?=?0.43-1.00) at the threshold level. The application of ELAPE is more effective in reducing the chance of 3 years LR, mortality, IBP involvement and CRM positivity than conventional APE, and worthy of being widely applied in surgical treatment of the distal rectal cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29383628,"To determine the prognostic role of tamoxifen therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) according to molecular subtypes. Data of 14,944 patients with DCIS were analyzed. Molecular subtypes were classified into four categories based on expression of estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Kaplan-Meier estimator was used for overall survival analysis while Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Luminal A subtype (ER/PR+, HER2-) showed higher (P?=?.009) survival rate than triple-negative (TN) subtype. Tamoxifen therapy group showed superior (P?<?.001) survival than no-tamoxifen therapy group. It had survival benefit only for luminal A subtype (P?=?.001). Tamoxifen therapy resulted in higher survival rate in subgroups with positive ER (P?=?.006), positive PR (P?=?.009), and negative HER2 (P?<?.001). In luminal A subtype, tamoxifen therapy showed lower hazard ratio (HR) compared to no-tamoxifen therapy (HR, 0.420; 95% CI 0.250-0.705; P?=?.001). Tamoxifen therapy was a significant independent factor by multivariate analysis (HR, 0.538; 95% CI 0.306-0.946; P?=?.031) as well as univariate analysis. Tamoxifen therapy group showed superior prognosis than the no-tamoxifen therapy group. Its prognostic influence was only effective for luminal A subtype. Patients with luminal A subtype showed higher survival rate than those with TN subtype. Active tamoxifen therapy is recommended for DCIS patients with luminal A subtype, and routine tests for ER, PR, and HER2 should be considered for DCIS.",breast_neoplasms
29382006,"Acinic cell carcinoma (AcCC) of the breast is a rare histological type of malignant epithelial neoplasm exhibiting acinic cell differentiation. A 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a palpable mass over the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Physical examination revealed an irregular mass in the lateral upper quadrant of the left breast, approximately 1.5?cm in diameter. Histologically, the tumor cells were round to oval, had displaced nuclei with striking single nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm, and contained large coarse cytoplasmic granules. They showed an infiltrating growth pattern with a combination of cystic and cribriform feature. We diagnosed the tumor as AcCC of the breast. The patient was given a simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. After the surgery, AcCC of the breast was confirmed histologically. The patient was symptom free 3?months after surgery. AcCC of the breast is a very rare tumor, and its prognosis appears to be good. Thus, treatment followed the guidelines for invasive breast carcinoma and no further therapy was suggested by oncologists based on the tumor biology.",breast_neoplasms
29378343,"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a rare complication of some malignant cancers. It is most commonly described in women with gynecologic or breast malignancies; however, there have been reports in other types of cancers. Symptoms include ataxia, dysarthria, and tremors, which could be the first manifestations of an underlying malignancy. A 50-year-old woman had an acute PCD with anti-Yo antibodies from an underlying breast invasive ductal carcinoma. She presented with intracranial hypertension in the posterior cranial fossa that required an emergent decompressive craniectomy. PCD is an uncommon disease that may manifest initially as posterior cranial fossa hypertension and subsequent acute hydrocephalus owing to diffuse cerebellar swelling. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of an anti-Yo PCD that has manifested as acute posterior cranial fossa hypertension owing to diffuse cerebellar edema. Early diagnosis and treatment should be pursued to improve long-term outcomes.",breast_neoplasms
29376219,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer. To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions:1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans. We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants. We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,444 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk.Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed.In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender.We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation. Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding.Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.",breast_neoplasms
29374745,"It is possible that the degree of enhancement on contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), a new diagnostic method, might provide prognostic information for breast cancer patients. Therefore, in a group of 82 breast cancer patients, we analyzed the prognostic significance of degree and pattern of enhancement on CESM as well as its relation to: (a) breast cancer immunophenotype (based on ER/PR/HER2 status) (b) podoplanin expression in cancer stroma (lymphatic vessel density plus podoplanin-positivity of cancer-associated fibroblasts), and (c) other histological parameters. For each tumor the intensity of enhancement on CESM was qualitatively assessed as strong or weak/medium, while the pattern - as homogenous and heterogenous. Herein we report, for the first time, that strong and heterogenous enhancement on CESM was related to unfavorable disease-free survival of breast cancer patients (p=0.005). Moreover, the strong enhancement was more frequent in large and node-positive tumors (pT>1, pN>0) (p=0.002), as well as in carcinomas with podoplanin-sparse stroma (p=0.008). Intensity and pattern of enhancement on CESM might provide (together with the results of other diagnostic imaging methods) not only the confirmation of presence or absence of tumor, but also prognostic information.",breast_neoplasms
29374718,"A considerable proportion of patients with incurable cancer experience dyspnea. This study evaluates associations between the feeling of dyspnea, as quantified by radiotherapy patients scoring their symptoms before palliative treatment with the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS), and potential underlying causes. Retrospective comparison of the incidence of different parameters that could cause a feeling of dyspnea in two groups, patients with no or minimal dyspnea (ESAS score 0-2) and those with dyspnea scores >2. The mean dyspnea score of all 102 patients was 2.6. Dyspnea scores >2 were present in 68% of patients with lung cancer, 50% of those with breast cancer, 39% of those with prostate cancer and 26% of those with other tumors (p=0.025). Dyspnea scores >2 were also present in 69% of patients with pleural effusion (vs. 40% in patients without pleural effusion), p=0.031. Among patients treated with palliative thoracic radiotherapy, 71% had dyspnea scores >2 (40% if other targets were irradiated), p=0.041. In 13% of patients, anemia and pulmonary comorbidity were the most likely explanation for dyspnea. In 29% the feeling of dyspnea could not be related to objective findings. In the majority of patients, the feeling of dyspnea was associated with the presence of thoracic metastases with or without pleural effusion from extrathoracic primary tumors or with a lung cancer diagnosis. A substantial proportion of patients reported dyspnea that could be related neither to cancer burden nor comorbidity.",breast_neoplasms
29374715,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of most distressing adverse events during cancer chemotherapy. In breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, CINV is poorly controlled. The prevalence of guideline-consistent antiemetic medication and control of CINV were investigated retrospectively in breast cancer patients receiving the first cycle of AC chemotherapy. Risks for CINV were analyzed by the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The effect of olanzapine added to the standard antiemetic medication on the incidence of CINV was subsequently evaluated in separate patients who received the first cycle of AC chemotherapy. Although the guideline-consistent antiemetic medication was performed in all subjects, the control rate of nausea (32%), but not vomiting (78%) was low. Risk analysis indicated that age younger than 55-year-old was a significant factor that reduces the control of both nausea and vomiting. Olanzapine (5 mg/day for 5 days), when added to the standard three-drug antiemetic medication, significantly improved the control of nausea and complete response. CINV was poorly controlled in breast cancer patients receiving AC chemotherapy, in which age younger than 55-year-old was a significant risk for both nausea and vomiting. Olanzapine was effective for improvement of the control of CINV associated with AC chemotherapy. Therefore, care should be taken to prevent CINV in young patients receiving AC chemotherapy by adding olanzapine to the standard three-drug antiemetic medication.",breast_neoplasms
29374694,"Hair dye may contain mutagenic compounds which could be associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in women who use it. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the personal use of hair dyes and the risk of breast cancer. We conducted a literature review of epidemiological studies reporting breast cancer-specific risks among hair dye users versus non-users. The data for the incidence of breast cancer following the 'ever' use of hair dye in studies which met the inclusion criteria was analysed using a meta-analysis. The relative risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined. A total of eight case-control studies published between 1980 and 2017 met the selection criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to non-users, using a random effects model and the Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure to adjust for publication bias in the presence of between studies heterogeneity, the adjusted RR for women using hair dyes was 1.1885 (95% CI=1.03228-1.36835). This indicates an 18.8% increased risk of future development of breast cancer among hair dye users. Although further work is required to confirm our results and clarify potential mechanisms, our findings suggest that exposure to hair dyes may contribute to an increased breast cancer risk.",breast_neoplasms
29374471,"Morinda citrifolia L. that was reported with immunomodulating and cytotoxic effects has been traditionally used to treat multiple illnesses including cancer. An anthraquinone derived from fruits of Morinda citrifolia L., nordamnacanthal, is a promising agent possessing several in vitro biological activities. However, the in vivo anti-tumor effects and the safety profile of nordamnacanthal are yet to be evaluated. In vitro cytotoxicity of nordamnacanthal was tested using MTT, cell cycle and Annexin V/PI assays on human MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Mice were orally fed with nordamnacanthal daily for 28?days for oral subchronic toxicity study. Then, the in vivo anti-tumor effect was evaluated on 4T1 murine cancer cells-challenged mice. Changes of tumor size and immune parameters were evaluated on the untreated and nordamnacanthal treated mice. Nordamnacanthal was found to possess cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB231, MCF-7 and 4T1 cells in vitro. Moreover, based on the cell cycle and Annexin V results, nordamnacanthal managed to induce cell death in both MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells. Additionally, no mortality, signs of toxicity and changes of serum liver profile were observed in nordamnacanthal treated mice in the subchronic toxicity study. Furthermore, 50?mg/kg body weight of nordamncanthal successfully delayed the progression of 4T1 tumors in Balb/C mice after 28?days of treatment. Treatment with nordamnacanthal was also able to increase tumor immunity as evidenced by the immunophenotyping of the spleen and YAC-1 cytotoxicity assays. Nordamnacanthal managed to inhibit the growth and induce cell death in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro and cease the tumor progression of 4T1 cells in vivo. Overall, nordamnacanthal holds interesting anti-cancer properties that can be further explored.",breast_neoplasms

However, about 40% of patients with ER±	+	breast cancer who receive tamoxifen therapy eventually develop resistance resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to mine available data sets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples), and to identify all miRNAs associated with tamoxifen resistance (TamR) in breast cancer. Secondly, this study aimed to predict the key gene regulatory networks of newly found TamR-related miRNAs and evaluate the potential role of the miRNAs and targets as potential prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients. Microarray data sets from two different studies were used from the GEO database: 1. GSE66607: miRNA of MCF-7 TamR cells; 2. GSE37405: TamR tissues. Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in both data sets and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to overlap between the two data sets. Profiles of GSE37405 and data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) along with Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were used to reveal the relationship between these 5 miRNAs and overall survival.

29370209,"Targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) has potential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling regulator of VEGF/VEGFR pathways. We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal bioimaging. We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2 group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group). The TTAC-10 group showed good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10 group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index in histopathologic analyses. We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001 effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29370182,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical gastrectomy is preferred for locally advanced gastric cancer. To avoid the problematic use of pTNM for patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) gastric cancer TNM staging system (8th edition) added ypTNM for the first time. But patients achieving pathological complete response were not covered by the new ypTNM staging system. To investigate whether pathological complete response is associated with better outcome in gastric cancer, as was reported in rectal, breast and bladder cancer. We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Collaboration's Central register of controlled trials from January 1988 to April 2015 for publications which reported outcomes of patients with and without pathological complete response (pCR) (pT0N0M0) to investigate whether pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) treated with radical surgery is associated with better survival. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The secondary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Both were measured with a relative risk (RR). A meta-analysis was performed using the fixed effects model. Forest plots and the Q test was used to evaluate overall heterogeneity for OS and DFS. A total of seven trials, 1143 patients were included and analyzed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical surgery with no other preoperative treatment. The average rate of pCR was 6.74% (range: 3%-15%). The RR of patients who achieved pCR in the primary tumor and lymph nodes is 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.98; p = 0.04), 0.34 (95% CI, 0.21-0.55; p<0.0001) and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.30-0.63; p<0.0001) for one-year-OS, three-year-OS and five-year-OS, respectively. The summary RR for three-year-DFS was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25-0.72; p = 0.002).

An age-period-cohort model was used to estimate the incidence and mortality. The Global Burden of Disease Study Group method was used to calculate the years of life lost and years lived with disability in breast cancer patients using a nationwide cancer registry. The population attributable risks were calculated using meta-analyzed relative risk ratios and by assessing the prevalence of risk factors. Women's reproductive/lifestyle changes, including advanced maternal age at first childbirth (from 37 to 85 disability-adjusted life years [DALYs] per 100,000 person-years), total period of breastfeeding (from 22 to 46 DALYs per 100,000 person-years), obesity (from 37 to 61 DALYs per 100,000 person-years), alcohol consumption (from 19 to 39 DALYs per 100,000 person-years), oral contraceptive use (from 18 to 27 DALYs per 100,000 person-years), and hormone replacement therapy use (from 2 to 3 DALYs per 100,000 person-years) were identified as factors likely to increase the burden of breast cancer from 2013 to 2030. Approximately, 34.2% to 44.3% of the burden of breast cancer could be avoidable in 2030 with reduction in reproductive/lifestyle risk factors. The rapid changes of age structure and lifestyle in South Korea during the last decade are expected to strongly increase the breast cancer burden over time unless the risk factors can be effectively modified.",breast_neoplasms

This work assesses its impact for local irradiation in terms of side effects, as well as tumour control in locally advanced (LABC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We retrospectively reviewed data of 66 patients with LABC and MBC. Patients received standard fractionated radiotherapy by HT, with or without concurrent systemic treatment. The median age was 60 years (28-77). The median follow-up of the population was 35.9 months (10.6-95.8). For 91% of patients, HT was concomitant with systemic treatments. Three patients experienced grade 3 skin toxicity and all had concurrent 5FU-vinorelbine. One patient who was receiving concurrent treatment with trastuzumab-pertuzumab had a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction by 14%. No late cardiac or lung toxicity was observed. A clinical benefit was observed in 75% of cases. At 2 months after HT, we observed tumour regression in 7/8 patients, as following: 1 complete, 4 partial responses, and 2 stable disease. The median survival for MBC group was 64.4 months (42.6-65.8) and 21.1 (6.1-36.1) months for LABC. This study suggests that the use of HT is well tolerated and feasible with a multimodal strategy that includes concurrent systemic treatments for patients with LABC and MBC.

Data on women aged 50?69 screened during a 9-year period were obtained from the Croatian Cancer Registry and Institute of Public Health reports. Participation rate and performance indicators were examined. The total of 57,428 women were invited to mammography screening in BBC during a 9-year period and 31,402 mammograms in total were performed. The response rate of 84% in BBC was consistently higher than the national average of about 60% reported in 2007, 2013 and 2014. The National Programme in BBC has been carried out continuously for nine years with a higher response rate compared with the national average, as a result of additional efforts of the Croatian Institute of Public Health team, as well as good cooperation among all programme stakeholders.

Whilst numerous studies analyzed efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy (HT) alone in hormone receptor positive patients, there is a lack of research looking at the usefulness of a preoperative combinatorial approach of CT and HT in this patient subgroup. Using a predictive model previously described in the literature, developed to analyze the probability of benefit from preoperative chemotherapy, we were able to compare pathological complete response (pCR) rates expected with the use of CT alone with the pCR rates reported in a population of 192 patients treated with the combination of tamoxifen plus anthracycline-based CT at Cremona Hospital between 2003 and 2006. Even with a relatively small patient population, this approach provided insightful information for the selection of hormone receptor positive BC patients most likely to benefit from the use of preoperative HT and CT in combination. Whilst no statistically significant benefit was obtained with the addition of tamoxifen to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the entire population, or in any of the molecular stratification subgroups, the analysis of the calibration curve showed that a combinatorial approach may improve pCR in patients with luminal B tumors. More specific trials should be designed to confirm our initial results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the efficacy of the combination of CT and HT in the neoadjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive BC.",breast_neoplasms

Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the Saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state's cancer registry. Vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate SIR and SMR in comparison to the autochthonous population. Tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. Odds ratios (OR) for an advanced tumor stage were modeled in dependence of re-settler-status and relevant covariates by logistic regression. Missing values were addressed in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of duration of stay in Germany on advanced stage diagnosis was analyzed among re-settlers. SIR and SMR of lung and breast cancer were lower among female re-settlers, while SIR and SMR of colorectal and prostate cancer were lower among male re-settlers. SIR and SMR of stomach cancer were elevated among both sexes. Female re-settlers showed an elevated OR for being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer. Both male and female re-settlers showed an elevated OR when observing all six sites combined (OR among males 1.47, p?=?0.04; OR among females 1.37, p?=?0.05). The result of elevated ORs was supported in the sensitivity analysis. Finally, male re-settlers showed a weak association between duration of stay in Germany and reduced risk for advanced stage diagnosis. Re-settlers were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. These findings are in line with previous research having shown unfavorable health care utilization of re-settlers. Overall, low mortality rates despite an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis argue for a sufficient follow-up care, comparable to the autochthonous population.",breast_neoplasms
29338541,"If we use only volumetry for measuring lymphedema, we could underdiagnose lymphedema with characteristics of biomechanical changes without definite volume change, especially in the medial forearm. In total, 158 breast cancer patients participated in this study. Arm volume was measured by water displacement volumetry, and segmental volumes were calculated from circumferences by using the truncated cone method. Subcutaneous ultrasound echogenicities were assessed on the medial side of the upper arm and forearm of both arms and graded by subcutaneous echogenicity grade (SEG) and revised SEG (rSEG). The standards for diagnosing secondary lymphedema were according to the volume change and clinical stage. Sensitivity, specificity, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were used. Analysis of ROC curves yielded AUCs of 0.875-0.933 (p?<?0.001). Volume differences in each segment were significantly different among the grades by SEG. The highest AUC was found for volume difference (AUC?=?0.919, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.860-0.978) in the upper arm near the elbow; however, in the medial forearm, the highest AUC was found for rSEG (AUC?=?0.948, 95% CI?=?0.923-0.965 in the proximal forearm; AUC?=?0.940, 95% CI?=?0.923-0.965 in the distal forearm). Our findings support the use of SEG by ultrasound in the assessment of lymphedema, especially in the medial region of the forearm. Subcutaneous ultrasound echogenicities may improve the accuracy of diagnosis of lymphedema in the forearm.",breast_neoplasms

Survey data were collected from 140 postmenopausal BCa patients and 41 healthy postmenopausal control respondents. BCa patients reported on average more frequent mouth sores/mucositis (5-point scale with 1 = never: 1.63 vs. 1.14; p < .01), glossadynia (1.60 vs. 1.07; p < .01), xerostomia (2.48 vs. 1.40; p < .01), and dysgeusia (2.10 vs. 1.46; p < .01) than the control respondents. Patients undergoing chemotherapy were more aware that cancer treatment can affect their oral health than patients on tamoxifen/AI (93% vs. 55%/56%; p < .001). BCa patients reported being more frequently informed by oncologists about oral health-related effects of cancer treatment than by dentists. Oncologists/nurses were more likely to communicate about oral health-related treatment effects with patients undergoing chemotherapy than patients on tamoxifen or AIs. Few BCa patients perceived dentists as knowledgeable about cancer treatment-related oral concerns and trusted them less than oncologists. BCa treatments impact oral health.

29334607,"We aimed to describe the temporal trends and district-level geographical variations in cancer incidences throughout Korea during 1999-2013. Data were obtained from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database. We calculated the age-standardized cumulative cancer incidences according to sex and geographical region (metropolitan cities, provinces, and districts) for three 5-year periods (1999-2003, 2004-2008, and 2009-2013). Each quintile interval contained the same number of regions. Disease maps were created to visualize regional differences in the cancer incidences. Substantial differences in cancer incidences were observed according to district and cancer type. The largest variations between geographical regions were found for thyroid cancer among both men and women. There was little variation in the incidences of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancer according to geographical region. Substantially elevated incidences of specific cancers were observed in Jeollanam-do (thyroid); Daejeon (colorectum); Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do (lung); Seocho-gu, Gangnam-gu, and Seongnam, Bundang-gu (breast and prostate); Chungcheong and Gyeongsang provinces (stomach); Ulleung-gun and the southern districts of Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollanam-do (liver); and along the Nakdonggang River (gallbladder and biliary tract). Mapping regional cancer incidences in Korea allowed us to compare the results according to geographical region.

29332027,"Phyllodes tumors (PT) are uncommon biphasic tumors, accounting for less than 1% of all breast primary neoplasms. They form a wide variety of tumors ranging from benign to malignant. Several histological features are used to grade PT into 3 categories: benign (grade?I), borderline (grade?II) and malignant (grade?III) tumors. The aim of our study was to analyse histolopathological, radiological and clinical features of PT from an experience of a single center. It was a retrospective study including 106 patients diagnosed with phyllodes tumors on surgical specimens at the department of pathology, of Hassan II university hospital (Fez, Morocco), from 2009 to 2016. The mean age was 33.81 years (range of 13-66?years), and the mean age increases with the tumor grade (mean ages of 32.32, 32.87 and 33.65 years respectively for grade I, II and III PT) (p = 0.023); 78 patients (73.58%) had benign PT, 20 (18.86%) had borderline PT and 8 (7.54%) patients were diagnosed with malignant PT. Mostly, the tumor size was <5?cm (63.2%), with BI-RADS 3 (51 patients, 48.11%). The tumor size and the radiological suspicion (ACR/BI-RADS) increased with the tumor grade (p < 0.001). Mitosis count, cellular atypia and stromal cellularity increased with the tumor grade (p < 0.001). Also, the presence of necrosis is associated with malignant PT (p < 0.001). Before surgery, patients had undergone core needle biopsies (CNB) for diagnostic purpose, and the overral sensitivity of this diagnostic procedure was 71.83%. The sentivity of the CNB decreased from grade?I PT to grade?III PT (from 56.81% to 37.5%), however its specificity increased from grade I to grade?III PT (from 59.25% to 100%). Phyllodes tumors of the breast are rare neoplasms with a wide range of clinicopathologic presentations. The core needle biopsy has a good diagnostic sensitivity compared to definitive diagnosis on surgical specimens. There was a statistically significant association between the histological grade of PT and tumor size, radiological suspicion, mitotic count, cellular atypia, stromal cellularity, and tumor necrosis.",breast_neoplasms
29330934,"Background: Bisphenol?A (BPA) is an estrogen-like chemical widely contained in daily supplies. There is evidence that environmental exposure to BPA could contribute to the development of hormone-related cancers. As is reported in numerous studies, melatonin, an endogenous hormone secreted by the pineal gland, could markedly inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast cancer (BC) cells. In this study, we intended to reveal the effects of melatonin on BPA-induced proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive BC cells. Methods: We used methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, luciferase reporter gene and western blotting assays to testify the effect of melatonin on BPA-mediated proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and colony formation assays showed that melatonin could significantly abolish BPA-elevated cell proliferation. Meanwhile, BPA-upregulated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was decreased by melatonin treatment. Mechanistically, we found that BPA was capable of upregulating the protein levels of steroid receptor coactivators (SRC-1, SRC-3), as well as promoting the estrogen response element activity. However, the addition of melatonin could remarkably block the elevation of steroid receptor coactivators expression and estrogen response element activity triggered by BPA. Conclusions: Therefore, these results demonstrated that melatonin could abrogate BPA-induced proliferation of BC cells. Therapeutically, melatonin could be regarded as a potential medication for BPA-associated BC.",breast_neoplasms
29327245,"Mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) are important substrates of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase family. MSK1 and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases, with MSK1 being suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration, invasion and tumour growth. The aim of the current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour specimens, evaluating its prognostic significance. A large cohort of 1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the expression of MSK1. Protein expression was examined using standard immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Low MSK1 protein expression was associated with younger age (P?=?0.004), higher tumour grade (P?<?0.001), higher Nottingham Prognostic Index scores (P?=?0.007), negative ER (P?<?0.001) and PR (P?<?0.001) status, and with triple-negative (P?<?0.001) and basal-like (P?<?0.001) phenotypes. Low MSK1 protein expression was significantly associated with shorter time to distant metastasis (P?<?0.001), and recurrence (P?=?0.013) and early death due to breast cancer (P?=?0.01). This association between high MSK1 expression and improved breast cancer-specific survival was observed in the whole cohort (P?=?0.009) and in the HER2-negative and non-basal like tumours (P?=?0.006 and P?=?0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis including other prognostic variables indicated that MSK1 is not an independent marker of outcome. High MSK1 is associated with improved breast cancer-specific survival in early stage invasive breast cancer patients, and has additional prognostic value in HER2-negative and non-basal like disease. Although not an independent marker of outcome, we believe such findings and significant associations with well-established negative prognostic factors (age, grade, Nottingham Prognostic Index, hormone receptor status, time to distant metastasis, recurrence and triple-negative/basal-like status) warrant further examination and validation in independent patient cohorts.",breast_neoplasms
29324832,"The lower breast cancer incidence in Asian populations compared with Western populations has been speculated to be caused by environmental and genetic variation. Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological subtypes in Asian breast cancer. At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated. In the present study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates. For all breast cancer patients, miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated, and miR-21, miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 were up-regulated. In very young patients (age < 35 y/o), the expression of 3 and 8 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated, respectively. In young patients (36-40 y/o), 3 and 3 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated, respectively. miR-532-5p was up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer. Differential miRNA expressions between normal and tumor tissues were observed in different age groups and tumor subtypes. Evolutionarily conserved miRNA clusters, which initiate malignancy transformation, were up-regulated in the breast cancers of very young patients. None of the significantly altered miRNAs were observed in postmenopausal patients.",breast_neoplasms

The?aim of this study is the evaluation of skin toxicity and cosmesis, and early clinical outcome of DCIS patients enrolled in an institutional Phase II trial of hypofractionated breast irradiation. 137 DCIS patients were enrolled in the trial. All patients underwent volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to the whole breast with a total dose of 40.5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks, without tumour bed boost. Acute and late skin toxicities were recorded. Cosmetic outcomes were assessed as excellent/good or fair/poor. Early clinical outcome was reported. Median age was 58 y.o. (range 30-86). The median follow-up time was 22 months (range 6-45). At the end of the radiotherapy, skin toxicity was grade G1 in 56% of the patients, G2 in 15%, no patients presented G3 toxicity. In the range of 3-9 months of follow-up, the skin toxicity was G1 in 28% of patients, no G2-G3 cases; cosmetic outcome was good/excellent in 95% of patients. In the follow-up interval of 9-24 months, the skin toxicity was G1 in 12% of patients, no G2-G3 toxicity; cosmetic outcome was good/excellent in 96% of patients. After an early evaluation of clinical outcomes, 5 patients (3.6%) presented an in-breast?recurrence. Hypofractionated radiotherapy using VMAT is a viable option for DCIS. A longer follow-up is needed to assess clinical outcomes and late toxicity.

29318276,"Given recent advances in screening mammography and adjuvant therapy (treatment), quantifying their separate and combined effects on US breast cancer mortality reductions by molecular subtype could guide future decisions to reduce disease burden. To evaluate the contributions associated with screening and treatment to breast cancer mortality reductions by molecular subtype based on estrogen-receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu). Six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 using national data on plain-film and digital mammography patterns and performance, dissemination and efficacy of ER/ERBB2-specific treatment, and competing mortality. Multiple US birth cohorts were simulated. Screening mammography and treatment. The models compared age-adjusted, overall, and ER/ERBB2-specific breast cancer mortality rates from 2000 to 2012 for women aged 30 to 79 years relative to the estimated mortality rate in the absence of screening and treatment (baseline rate); mortality reductions were apportioned to screening and treatment. In 2000, the estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 37% (model range, 27%-42%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2000 of 64 deaths (model range, 56-73) per 100?000 women: 44% (model range, 35%-60%) of this reduction was associated with screening and 56% (model range, 40%-65%) with treatment. In 2012, the estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 49% (model range, 39%-58%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2012 of 63 deaths (model range, 54-73) per 100?000 women: 37% (model range, 26%-51%) of this reduction was associated with screening and 63% (model range, 49%-74%) with treatment. Of the 63% associated with treatment, 31% (model range, 22%-37%) was associated with chemotherapy, 27% (model range, 18%-36%) with hormone therapy, and 4% (model range, 1%-6%) with trastuzumab. The estimated relative contributions associated with screening vs treatment varied by molecular subtype: for ER+/ERBB2-, 36% (model range, 24%-50%) vs 64% (model range, 50%-76%); for ER+/ERBB2+, 31% (model range, 23%-41%) vs 69% (model range, 59%-77%); for ER-/ERBB2+, 40% (model range, 34%-47%) vs 60% (model range, 53%-66%); and for ER-/ERBB2-, 48% (model range, 38%-57%) vs 52% (model range, 44%-62%). In this simulation modeling study that projected trends in breast cancer mortality rates among US women, decreases in overall breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 were associated with advances in screening and in adjuvant therapy, although the associations varied by breast cancer molecular subtype.",breast_neoplasms
29310379,"Although still relatively rare, multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMNs) have been increasingly reported in recent years. A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a painless, incidental left axillary lump. Ultrasound showed enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. An excisional biopsy was conducted on 3 lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was determined to be metastatic adenocarcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the lymph nodes. Further physical examination of the patient yielded a 1.5-cm hard, left subareolar mass. The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy. The diagnosis was grade II invasive ductal carcinoma (stage IIA). The axillary lymph node showed MCL (stage I, group A), but not metastatic ductal carcinoma. The patient received chemotherapy, including 6 courses of CHOP (A chemotherapy protocol consists of cyclophosphamide 1.2?g day 1, doxorubicin 80?mg day 1, vindesine 4?mg day1, and prednisone 90?mg from day 1 to 5) for lymphoma and breast cancer. The patient was also administered endocrine therapy. After a 54-month follow-up, the patient was well with no evidence of disease. MPMNs are easily misdiagnosed as a primary and metastatic tumor, leading to delayed or erroneous treatment. Male breast cancer in a patient with MCL is rare. Early diagnosis and proper therapy are necessary for an optimal prognosis. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms and risk factors of MPMNs.",breast_neoplasms
29306943,"Twenty to fifty percent of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancers express mutations within the ER ligand-binding domain. While most studies focused on the constitutive ER signaling activity commonly engendered by these mutations selected during estrogen deprivation therapy, our study was aimed at investigating distinctive phenotypes conferred by different mutations within this class. We examined the two most prevalent mutations, D538G and Y537S, employing corroborative genome-edited and lentiviral-transduced ER+ T47D cell models. We used a luciferase-based reporter and endogenous phospho-ER immunoblot analysis to characterize the estrogen response of ER mutants and determined their resistance to known ER antagonists. Consistent with their selection during estrogen deprivation therapy, these mutants conferred constitutive ER activity. While Y537S mutants showed no estrogen dependence, D538G mutants demonstrated an enhanced estrogen-dependent response. Both mutations conferred resistance to ER antagonists that was overcome at higher doses acting specifically through their ER target. These observations provide a tenable hypothesis for how D538G ESR1-expressing clones can contribute to shorter progression-free survival observed in the exemestane arm of the BOLERO-2 study. Thus, in those patients with dominant D538G-expressing clones, longitudinal analysis for this mutation in circulating free DNA may prove beneficial for informing more optimal therapeutic regimens.",breast_neoplasms

A historical cohort of 602 women newly diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during 2009-2011 at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto, Johannesburg, was followed using health systems data to December 2014. 'Overall survival' time was defined from diagnosis to death or terminal illness. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) associated with woman and tumour characteristics. During a median 2.1 years follow-up (IQR 0.5-3.8), 149 women died or were classified terminally ill; 287 were lost-to-follow-up. 3-year survival was 84% for early stage (I/II) and 56% for late stage (III/IV) tumours (late v early: HR 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9-4.1), however the 42% cumulative losses to follow-up over this period were greater for late stage, half of which occurred within 6 months of diagnosis. After mutual adjustment for stage, grade, age, receptor subtype and HIV status, lower survival was also associated with triple negative (HR 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0)) and HER2-enriched (2.5 (95% CI: 1.4-4.5)) compared to ER/PR+ HER2- tumours, but not with age or HIV-infection (1.4 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.3)). In this South African cohort, breast cancer survival is suboptimal, but was better for early stage and hormone receptor-positive tumours. Efforts to reduce clinic losses in the immediate post-diagnosis period, in addition to early presentation and accelerated diagnosis and treatment, are needed to prevent breast cancer deaths, and survival improvements need to be monitored using prospective studies with active follow-up.",breast_neoplasms
29304944,"Over the past decade, the benefits and harms balance of breast cancer (BC) screening has been widely debated. To elicit women's trade-offs between the benefits and harms of BC screening and to analyze the main determinants of these trade-offs. A discrete-choice experiment with seven attributes depicting BC screening programs including varying levels of BC mortality, overdiagnosis, and false-positive result was used. Eight hundred twelve women aged 40 to 74 years with no personal history of BC recruited by a survey institute and representative of the French general population (age, socioeconomic level, and geographical location) completed the discrete-choice experiment. Preference heterogeneity was investigated using generalized multinomial logit models from which individual trade-offs were derived, and their main determinants were assessed using generalized linear models. Screening acceptance rates under various benefits and harms ratios were simulated on the basis of the distribution of individual preferences. The women would be willing to accept on average 14.1 overdiagnosis cases (median = 9.6) and 47.8 false-positive results (median = 27.2) to avoid one BC-related death. After accounting for preference heterogeneity, less than 50% of women would be willing to accept 10 overdiagnosis cases for one BC-related death avoided. Screening acceptance rates were higher among women with higher socioeconomic level and lower among women with poor health. Women are sensitive to both the benefits and the harms of BC screening and their preferences are highly heterogeneous. Our study provides useful results for public health authorities and clinicians willing to improve their recommendations of BC screening on the basis of women's preferences.",breast_neoplasms
29302764,"Few studies have evaluated the performance of existing breast cancer risk prediction models among women of African ancestry. In replication studies of genetic variants, a change in direction of the risk association is a common phenomenon. Termed flip-flop, it means that a variant is risk factor in one population but protective in another, affecting the performance of risk prediction models. We used data from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer in the African diaspora (The Root consortium), which included 3686 participants of African ancestry from Nigeria, USA, and Barbados. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed from the published odds ratios (ORs) of four sets of susceptibility loci for breast cancer. Discrimination capacity was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Flip-flop phenomenon was observed among 30~40% of variants across studies. Using the 34 variants with consistent directionality among previous studies, we constructed a PRS with AUC of 0.531 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.512-0.550), which is similar to the PRS using 93 variants and ORs from European ancestry populations (AUC = 0.525, 95% CI: 0.506-0.544). Additionally, we found the 34-variant PRS has good discriminative accuracy in women with family history of breast cancer (AUC = 0.586, 95% CI: 0.532-0.640). We found that PRS based on variants identified from prior GWASs conducted in women of European and Asian ancestries did not provide a comparable degree of risk stratification for women of African ancestry. Further large-scale fine-mapping studies in African ancestry populations are desirable to discover population-specific genetic risk variants.",breast_neoplasms

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an imaging technique from which?apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can be calculated in addition to obtaining important structural information which cannot be obtained from other imaging studies. We did not find any significant relationships between ADC values and prognostic factors, but did provide some explanations for conflicting results in the literature. 2. Calculations were performed automatically by the device. Tissue samples were obtained for prognostic factor evaluation. The relationships between ADC and prognostic factors were investigated. Comparisons between groups were made with one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test. Pairwise comparisons were made with Dunn's test. Analyses of categorical variables were made with Chi-square test. We found a weak negative correlation between ADC and Ki-67 values (r = -0.279; p = 0.029). When we compared ADC values in regard to tumour type, we found no significant differences for tumour grade, Ki-67 positivity, estrogen receptor?positivity, progesterone receptor?positivity, C-erb B2, lymphovascular invasion and ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ?component. On a side note, we found that mean ADC values decreased as tumour grade increased; however, this was not statistically significant. The literature contains studies that report conflicting results which may be caused by differences in B values, ROI area and magnetic field strength. Multicentre studies and systematic reviews of these findings may produce crucial data for the use of DWI in breast cancer.

29298305,"Pathological response of breast cancer to chemotherapy is a prognostic indicator for long-term disease free and overall survival. Responses of locally advanced breast cancer in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) settings are often variable, and the prediction of response is imperfect. The purpose of this study was to detect primary tumor responses early after the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound (QUS), textural analysis and molecular features in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The study included ninety six patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breast tumors were scanned with a clinical ultrasound system prior to chemotherapy treatment, during the first, fourth and eighth week of treatment, and prior to surgery. Quantitative ultrasound parameters and scatterer-based features were calculated from ultrasound radio frequency (RF) data within tumor regions of interest. Additionally, texture features were extracted from QUS parametric maps. Prior to therapy, all patients underwent a core needle biopsy and histological subtypes and biomarker ER, PR, and HER2 status were determined. Patients were classified into three treatment response groups based on combination of clinical and pathological analyses: complete responders (CR), partial responders (PR), and non-responders (NR). Response classifications from QUS parameters, receptors status and pathological were compared. Discriminant analysis was performed on extracted parameters using a support vector machine classifier to categorize subjects into CR, PR, and NR groups at all scan times. Of the 96 patients, the number of CR, PR and NR patients were 21, 52, and 23, respectively. The best prediction of treatment response was achieved with the combination mean QUS values, texture and molecular features with accuracies of 78%, 86% and 83% at weeks 1, 4, and 8, after treatment respectively. Mean QUS parameters or clinical receptors status alone predicted the three response groups with accuracies less than 60% at all scan time points. Recurrence free survival (RFS) of response groups determined based on combined features followed similar trend as determined based on clinical and pathology. This work demonstrates the potential of using QUS, texture and molecular features for predicting the response of primary breast tumors to chemotherapy early, and guiding the treatment planning of refractory patients.",breast_neoplasms
29298171,"Class V Beta tubulin isotype (¥âV-tubulin) was recently found to have tissue-specific expression patterns in epithelial tissues with secretory function and aberrant expression in tumors. The aims of this pilot study were (a) to examine expression of ¥âV-tubulin in the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) of patients who underwent salpingectomy, (b) to characterize FTE atypia in high-risk patients with BRCA mutations, and (c) to determine expression of ¥âV-tubulin in serous ovarian neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry, with a highly specific antibody developed in our laboratory against human ¥âV-tubulin, was used to evaluate expression in paraffin-embedded sections of the fallopian tube (n = 82) and tumors (n = 13), from prospectively selected cases, categorized by reason for salpingectomy. ¥âV-tubulin, when present, was expressed in secretory cells and essentially never in ciliated cells of the FTE. Histologically ""l"" FTE had very rare, scattered ¥âV-tubulin-positive cells; percentage positivity increased in cases of serous ovarian neoplasms. The highest expression was observed in FTE from patients with BRCA mutant breast cancer. Four distinct types of FTE atypia were delineated in patients with known BRCA mutations. In a few additional test cases of ovarian neoplasms, ¥âV-tubulin was highly expressed, with the extent and intensity of staining elevated in high-grade serous carcinomas compared with serous borderline tumors. In summary, ¥âV-tubulin was localized to secretory cells of the distal FTE and its expression varied according to the clinical diagnosis. The frequency of these cells and thus expression of ¥âV-tubulin were dramatically enriched in tissue obtained from BRCA mutant cases, which also exhibited pronounced histologic atypia indicative of early predysplastic aberrations. Furthermore, elevated expression of ¥âV-tubulin correlated with poor differentiation status in serous ovarian neoplasms.SS pa",breast_neoplasms

Preliminary data on malignancies in low- and middle-income countries, specifically in Africa, suggest a higher mortality compared to other regions of the world, a difference partially explained by limited availability of screening and early detection systems as well as poorer access to treatment. To evaluate the diagnosed tumor burden in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and review literature on existing and suspected barriers to accessing appropriate oncologic care. This is a retrospective study carried out at Healthcare, Education, community Action, and Leadership development Africa, a 197-bed tertiary referral hospital, in the Province of North Kivu, along the eastern border of the DRC from 2012 to 2015. Patient charts were reviewed for diagnoses of presumed malignancy with biopsy results. A total of 252 cases of suspected cancer were reviewed during the study period; 39.7% were men. The average age of patients was 43?years. Amongst adult patients, the most common presenting condition involved breast lesions with 5.8% diagnosis of fibrocystic breast changes and 2.9% invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. 37.3% of female patients had lesions involving the cervix or uterus. The most common diagnosis amongst male adults was prostate disease (16.7% of men). For pediatric patients, the most common diagnoses involved bone and/or cartilage (27.3%) followed by skin and soft tissue lesions (20.0%). All patients underwent surgical resection of lesions; some patients were advised to travel out of country for chemotherapy and radiation for which follow-up data are unavailable. Adequate and timely treatment of malignancy in the DRC faces a multitude of challenges. Access to surgical services for diagnosis and management as well as chemotherapeutic agents is prohibitively limited. Increased collaboration with local clinicians and remote specialist consultants is needed to deliver subspecialty care in resource-poor settings.",breast_neoplasms
29288773,"Monolayer cell cultures have been considered the most suitable technique for in vivo cellular experiments. However, a lot of cellular functions and responses that are present in natural tissues are lost in two-dimensional cell cultures. In this context, nanoparticle accumulation data presented in literature are often not accurate enough to predict behavior of nanoparticles in vivo. Cellular spheroids show a higher degree of morphological and functional similarity to the tissues. Accumulation and distribution of carboxylated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), chosen as model nanoparticles, was investigated in cellular spheroids composed of different phenotype mammalian cells. The findings were compared with the results obtained in in vivo experiments with human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. The diffusive transport model was used for theoretical nanoparticles distribution estimation. QDs were accumulated only in cells, which were localized in the periphery of cellular spheroids. CdSe/ZnS QDs were shown to be stable and inert; they did not have any side-effects for cellular spheroids formation. Penetration of QDs in both cellular spheroids and in vivo tumor model was limited. The mathematical model confirmed the experimental results: nanoparticles penetrated only 25¥ìm into cellular spheroids after 24h of incubation. Penetration of negatively charged nanoparticles is limited not only in tumor tissue, but also in cellular spheroids. The results presented in this paper show the superior applicability of cellular spheroids to cell monolayers in the studies of the antitumor effect and penetration of nanomedicines.",breast_neoplasms
29286911,"Primary angiosarcoma of the breast is a rare entity with incidence of less than 0.05% of all malignant breast neoplasms. It occurs in young females without any associated risk factors. The tumor behaves aggressively and has a poor prognosis compared to invasive ductal carcinoma. It was a retrospective observational study done at a tertiary cancer center from January 2012 to December 2016. The medical records of patients diagnosed with primary breast angiosarcoma were reviewed for the study. Clinicopathological profile, treatment, and the outcomes were analyzed. Four patients were diagnosed with primary breast angiosarcoma out of 2560 breast cancer patients seen over a period of 5 years. Two had metastatic disease at presentation. Among four patients, two underwent surgery of the primary tumor, whereas, all received chemotherapy either as adjuvant or palliative setting. One patient received adjuvant radiation therapy. Three patients received 2nd line and one received 3rd line chemotherapy on disease progression. After a median follow-up of 18 months one patient was surviving on 3rd line chemotherapy with trabectedin. Other three succumbed to disease after progression. Due to a small number of this malignancy randomized studies are difficult to perform and optimum treatment strategy still need to be defined.",breast_neoplasms
29285045,"Breast cancer has a high prevalence in Korea. To achieve personalized therapy for breast cancer, long-term follow-up specimens are needed for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multigene analysis. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are easier to store than fresh frozen (FF) samples. The objective of this study was to optimize RNA extraction from FFPE blocks for NGS. RNA quality from FF and FFPE tissues (n=5), expected RNA amount per unit area, the relationship between archiving time and quantity/quality of FFPE-extracted RNA (n=14), differences in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and NGS results, and comparisons of both techniques with tissue processing at different institutions (n=96) were determined in this study. 2. Archiving time affected RNA quality, showing a negative correlation with RNA integrity number and a positive correlation with threshold cycle. However, RNA from samples as old as 10 years showed a 100% success rate in qRT-PCR using short primers, showing that the effect of archiving time can be overcome by proper experiment design. NGS showed a higher success rate than qRT-PCR. Specimens from institution B (n=46), which were often stored in a refrigerator for more than 6 hours and fixed without slicing, showed lower success rates and worse results than specimens from the other institutes. Archived FFPE tissues can be used to extract RNA for NGS if they are properly processed before fixation. The expected amount of RNA per unit size calculated in this study will be useful for other researchers.",breast_neoplasms

In this retrospective study, we examined a cohort of elderly patients with MBC receiving a range of treatments, in terms of demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes. Patients aged 65 years and older, and diagnosed with MBC between 2003 and 2015, were identified from the databases of three academic hospitals in South Korea. A total of 161 cases were eligible for inclusion. We assessed clinicopathologic features, treatment patterns, and outcomes, using the available electronic medical records. Based on age at MBC diagnosis, patients were divided into three groups: 65 to 69, 70 to 74, and ¡Ã75 years. Most patients had received active treatment according to biologic subtype as in younger patients, although frequent dose modifications were observed during chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 30.3 months; age (¡Ã70 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (¡Ã2), triple-negative cancer, and number of metastatic sites (¡Ã2) were significant poor prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analyses. All types of systemic treatments according to biologic subtype conferred more prolonged OS in patients receiving treatment. Patients aged ¡Ã75 years were more likely to have a poor ECOG PS and advanced comorbidity, and tended to receive less intensive treatments compared to the other age groups.

A total of 98 patients with stage II-III breast cancer were enrolled. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) rate of invasive cancer after the completion of the fourth cycle of NAC. The secondary endpoints included response rate (RR), rate of breast-conserving surgery, toxicity, and disease-free survival (DFS). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01352494). pCR in the breast and the axillary lymph node was observed in seven of the 98 enrolled patients (7.1%). The overall clinical RR, including partial responses, was 65.3%. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 75 of the 98 assessable patients (76.5%). Neutropenia was frequent and was observed in 92 of the 98 patients (93.9%), including grade 3 and 4 in 24 patients (24.5%) and 63 patients (64.3%), respectively. Dose reductions were required for 30 of the 92 patients (32.6%). After a median follow-up of 24 months, the overall DFS of the group was 86.7%. The combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine did not improve pCR.

The National Health Programme encompasses main risk factors, elimination of which may lead to a reduced incidence of illnesses in the society. At the same time, the criteria of selecting people eligible for preventive screening are established according to risk groups determined by sex, as well as age in the population of women. The perimenopausal and menopausal period contributes to occurrence of numerous systemic diseases and to an increased risk of illnesses, especially cancers. The objective of the research was to evaluate the performance of preventive screening tests of women after 50 aimed at early detection of cervical and breast cancer. Furthermore, the research estimated frequency of pathological lesions detected and regularity of their monitoring. The research covered 150 women after 50 years of age. The database was statistically examined with STATISTICA software. A low percentage of the respondents, in comparison to the risk increasing with age, had a Pap test (61.3%) and mammography (51.3%) in the last two years. In the case of women whose latest Pap test or mammography showed abnormalities and was the basis for diagnosing pathological lesions, 69.2% of them were under regular medical supervision if abnormalities were identified by a Pap test and 68.7% if lesions were detected in breast structure. In the examined group we observed a small percentage of women undergo Pap tests and mammography.

Although the majority of breast cancers in this age group express oestrogen receptor (ER), which makes endocrine therapy (primary or adjuvant) feasible, given the huge size of the elderly population, there remains a significant number of patients, in absolute term, whose tumours do not express ER and their management is challenging. Of a consecutive series of 1,758 older (e70 years) women with early operable primary breast cancer managed in a dedicated service from 1973-2010, 252(14.3%) had ER-negative (histochemical (H) score d50) tumours. Their clinical outcome was retrospectively reviewed and tumour samples collected from diagnostic core biopsies were analysed for progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 using immunohistochemistry. The commonest primary treatment was surgery (N = 194, 77%) followed by primary endocrine therapy (14.3%), primary radiotherapy (5.6%) and supportive treatment only (3.1%). Among the patients undergoing surgery, most of them had grade 3 (78.1%) and node-negative disease (62.2%). Some of them (21.1%) received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 37.5 months, 117 patients had died, out of which 48.6% were due to breast cancer. For those who underwent surgery, the regional and local recurrence rates were 2% and 1.1% per annum respectively. For those who received primary endocrine therapy, 38% progressed at 6 months, however all patients who had primary radiotherapy achieved clinical benefit at 6 months.

29281983,"Tumour progression involves a series of phenotypic changes to cancer cells, each of which presents therapeutic targets. Here, using techniques adapted from microbial experimental evolution, we investigate the evolution of tumour spreading - a precursor for metastasis and tissue invasion - in environments with varied resource supply. Evolutionary theory predicts that competition for resources within a population will select for individuals to move away from a natal site (i.e. disperse), facilitating the colonisation of unexploited resources and decreasing competition between kin. After approximately 100 generations in environments with low resource supply, we find that MCF7 breast cancer spheroids (small in vitro tumours) show increased spreading. Conversely, spreading slows compared to the ancestor where resource supply is high. Common garden experiments confirm that the evolutionary responses differ between selection lines; with lines evolved under low resource supply showing phenotypic plasticity in spheroid spreading rate. These differences in spreading behaviour between selection lines are heritable (stable across multiple generations), and show that the divergently evolved lines differ in their response to resource supply. We observe dispersal-like behaviour and an increased sensitivity to resource availability in our selection lines, which may be a response to selection, or alternatively may be due to epigenetic changes, provoked by prolonged resource limitation, that have persisted across many cell generations. Different clinical strategies may be needed depending on whether or not tumour progression is due to natural selection. This study highlights the effectiveness of experimental evolution approaches in cancer cell populations and demonstrates how simple model systems might enable us to observe and measure key selective drivers of clinically important traits.",breast_neoplasms

We examined the in vitro antitumor effects of lidocaine on various breast cancer cell lines and then assessed these properties in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro experiments: normal breast epithelial cells (NBEC) MCF-10A and three tumor breast epithelial cells (TBEC) lines (MCF-7 luminal A, MDA-MB-231 triple-negative and SKBr3 HER2 positive) were exposed to increasing concentrations of lidocaine. Cell viability, migration and anchorage-independent growth were assessed by MTT, wound healing, and soft-agar growth assays. In vivo experiments: 6-week-old severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected intraperitoneally with MDA-MB-231 cells and were treated with intraperitoneal lidocaine or phosphate-buffered saline. The mice were euthanized when they reached experimental endpoints or sacrificed to determine peritoneal carcinomatosis index and global tumor volumes. Lidocaine reduced the viability of all the cell lines, inhibited migration of TBEC compared to the NBEC, and compromised the anchorage-independent growth of the triple-negative cells. Intraperitoneal lidocaine improved survival of mice with MDA-MB-231 peritoneal carcinomatosis using doses that are consistent with the current clinical settings for analgesia. In agreement with the notion that local anesthesia may be beneficial for cancer therapy, lidocaine has a protective effect against breast cancer cells in experimental studies. However, the beneficial impact of local anesthetics on breast cancer needs to be strengthened by additional preclinical and clinical trials.",breast_neoplasms
29277358,"Lymphoedema is a dreadful complication following breast cancer therapy. According to the International Society of Lymphology, the consensus treatment for breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is the decongestive lymphatic therapy. This is a two-phase treatment and combines different treatment modalities including skin care, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression therapy and exercise. However, the additional effect of MLD is debated since pooled data only demonstrated a limited non-significant additional value. A possible explanation is that in previous studies MLD has been applied blind, without knowledge of patient-specific lymphatic routes of transport. In addition, the MLD hand manoeuvres used by the therapists in previous studies, possibly did not optimally stimulate lymphatic transport. Recently, near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been introduced to visualise the superficial lymphatic network which allows MLD at the most needed location. The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of the fluoroscopy-guided MLD, additional to the other parts of the decongestive lymphatic therapy and compared to the traditional or a placebo MLD, in the treatment of BCRL. A three-arm double-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted in different university hospitals in Belgium. Based on a sample size calculation, 201 participants with chronic BCRL stage 1 or 2 of the arm or hand, with at least 5% difference between both sides (corrected for hand dominance) need to be recruited. All participants receive the standard treatment: skin care, compression therapy and exercises. The intervention group additionally receives fluoroscopy-guided MLD. One control group additionally receives the traditional 'blind' MLD and a second control group receives a placebo MLD.

Among the common side effects related to T-DM1, thrombocytopenia and mucosal hemorrhage are seen, although they are infrequently judged to be clinically significant. Intracranial hemorrhages are extremely rare, and only 3 cases of hematomas have been reported in association with T-DM1 and remote radiotherapy, 2 of them with progressive enlargement. Herein we describe a patient who presented with a cerebellar hematoma that progressively enlarged over 8 months during treatment with T-DM1 and only a few months after whole-brain radiation therapy plus a stereotactic radiosurgery boost for a HER2-positive breast cancer cerebellar metastasis. The pathology of the hematoma was similar to that in previous cases and suggested a unique pathophysiology related to an interaction between T-DMI and radiation therapy. A progressively enlarging intraparenchymal hematoma can be seen just a few months after delivery of radiation therapy for a metastatic brain lesion in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who are receiving T-DM1.

Only a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in the literature to date. We report a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4 cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral treatment. Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis management.

29258115,"Trastuzumab is an important treatment used for patients with Her-2-positive breast cancer, but an increasing incidence of trastuzumab resistance has been observed clinically during the past decade. Aberrant microRNA (miR) expression levels are correlated with prognosis and response to trastuzumab in breast cancer. MiR-129-5p is downregulated in trastuzumab-resistant human breast cancer cells (JIMT-1), but its potential function and underlying mechanism remain unclear. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression levels of miR-129-5p and its potential target genes. The effects of miR-129-5p on cell responses to trastuzumab were analyzed by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays in Her-2-positive breast cancer cells (SKBR-3 and JIMT-1). Bio-informatics analyses were performed to predict target genes of miR-129-5p, and luciferase assays were carried out to confirm the binding of miR-129-5p and rpS6. MiR-129-5p, which was downregulated and predicted to target rpS6 in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells, enhanced the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab by reducing the expression of rpS6. Moreover, the overexpression of rpS6 reversed the sensitivity of cells to trastuzumab induced by miR-129-5p. MiR-129-5p sensitized Her-2-positive breast cancer to trastuzumab by downregulating rpS6. These findings provide novel insights into the common role of rpS6 and its related molecular mechanisms in mediating trastuzumab-resistance in Her-2-positive breast cancers.",breast_neoplasms

A protection disk was used to shield the thoracic wall. The results of in vivo MOSFET dosimetry for 27 patients and GAFROMIC film dosimetry for 20 patients were analysed. The entry dose for the breast tissue, measured with MOSFETs, (mean value 22.3?Gy, SD 3.4%) agreed within 1.7% with the expected dose (mean value 21.9?Gy). The dose in breast tissue, measured with GAFCHROMIC films (mean value 23.50?Gy) was on average within 0.7% (SD?=?3.7%, range -5.5% to 5.6%) of the prescribed dose of 23.33?Gy. The dose measured with MOSFETs and GAFROMIC EBT2 films agreed well with the expected dose. For both methods, the dose to the thoracic wall, lungs and heart for left sided patents was lower than 2.5?Gy even when 12?MeV was applied. The positioning time of GAFCHROMIC films is negligible and based on our results we recommend its use as a standard tool for patient quality assurance during breast cancer IORT.",breast_neoplasms

Health fairs are a common community outreach strategy used to provide cancer-related health education and services. This study was a process evaluation of seven health fairs focused on cancer screening across the U.S. We conducted key-informant interviews with the fair coordinator and conducted baseline and follow-up surveys with fair participants to describe characteristics of participants as well as their experiences. We collected baseline data with participants at the health fairs and telephone follow-up surveys 6?months following the fair. Attendance across the seven health fairs ranged from 41 to 212 participants. Most fairs provided group or individual education, print materials and cancer screening during the event. Overall, participants rated health fairs as very good and participants reported that the staff was knowledgeable and that they liked the materials distributed. After the fairs, about 60% of participants, who were reached at follow-up, had read the materials provided and had conversations with others about cancer screening, and 41% talked to their doctors about screening. Based on findings from evaluation including participant data and coordinator interviews, we describe 6 areas in planning for health fairs that may increase their effectiveness. These include: 1) use of a theoretical framework for health promotion to guide educational content and activities provided, 2) considering the community characteristics, 3) choosing a relevant setting, 4) promotion of the event, 5) considerations of the types of services to deliver, and 6) evaluation of the health fair. The events reported varied in reach and the participants represented diverse races and lower income populations overall.

29248134,"High oxidative stress as defined by hydroxyl and peroxyl activity is often found in the stroma of human breast cancers. Oxidative stress induces stromal catabolism, which promotes cancer aggressiveness. Stromal cells exposed to oxidative stress release catabolites such as lactate, which are up-taken by cancer cells to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The transfer of catabolites between stromal and cancer cells leads to metabolic heterogeneity between these cells and increased cancer cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in preclinical models. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and reverses stromal catabolism and stromal-carcinoma cell metabolic heterogeneity, resulting in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of cancer cells in experimental models of breast cancer. The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine if NAC could reduce markers of stromal-cancer metabolic heterogeneity and markers of cancer cell aggressiveness in human breast cancer. Subjects with newly diagnosed stage 0 and I breast cancer who were not going to receive neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection were treated with NAC before definitive surgery to assess intra-tumoral metabolic markers. NAC was administered once a week intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/kg and 600 mg twice daily orally on the days not receiving intravenous NAC. Histochemistry for the stromal metabolic markers monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and caveolin-1 (CAV1) and the Ki67 proliferation assay and TUNEL apoptosis assay in carcinoma cells were performed in pre- and post-NAC specimens. The range of days on NAC was 14-27 and the mean was 19 days. Post-treatment biopsies showed significant decrease in stromal MCT4 and reduced Ki67 in carcinoma cells. NAC did not significantly change stromal CAV1 and carcinoma TUNEL staining. NAC was well tolerated. NAC as a single agent reduces MCT4 stromal expression, which is a marker of glycolysis in breast cancer with reduced carcinoma cell proliferation. This study suggests that modulating metabolism in the tumor microenvironment has the potential to impact breast cancer proliferation.",breast_neoplasms

However, the relationship between alcohol and mortality among women with breast cancer is less clear. This study examines the effect of alcohol consumption on mortality in women affected with breast cancer at baseline from a high-risk family breast and ovarian cancer registry. We studied 1116 women affected with breast cancer at baseline from the Metropolitan New York Registry. The examined reported alcohol consumption (total of beer, wine, liquor) was defined as the average number of drinks per week reported from age 12 to age at baseline. We assessed vital status of each participant using participant or family reported data and we used the National Death Index to supplement deaths reported through family updates. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between alcohol intake and overall mortality (HRO), breast cancer-specific mortality (HRBC), and non-breast cancer mortality (HRNBC), adjusted for confounders. After a mean follow-up of 9.1 years, we observed 211 total deaths and 58 breast cancer deaths. Compared to non-drinkers, we found that both low and moderate to heavy levels of alcohol intake were not associated with greater overall mortality (¡Â3 drinks/week: HRO: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.38-1.14); > 3 drinks/week: HRO: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.85-1.58), breast cancer-specific mortality (¡Â 3 drinks/week: HRBC:0.62, 95% CI: 0.19-2.03; >3 drinks/week: HR BC: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.49-1.89), or non-breast cancer-specific mortality (¡Â3 drinks/week: HR NBC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.32-1.6; >3 drinks/week: HRNBC: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.75-1.86).

29237399,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression. Methylation can be modified by environmental exposures and changes in the methylation patterns have been associated with diseases. Methylation microarrays measure methylation levels at more than 450,000 CpGs in a single experiment, and the most common analysis strategy is to perform a single probe analysis to find methylation probes associated with the outcome of interest. However, methylation changes usually occur at the regional level: for example, genomic structural variants can affect methylation patterns in regions up to several megabases in length. Existing DMR methods provide lists of Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) of up to only few kilobases in length, and cannot check if a target region is differentially methylated. Therefore, these methods are not suitable to evaluate methylation changes in large regions. To address these limitations, we developed a new DMR approach based on redundancy analysis (RDA) that assesses whether a target region is differentially methylated. Using simulated and real datasets, we compared our approach to three common DMR detection methods (Bumphunter, blockFinder, and DMRcate). We found that Bumphunter underestimated methylation changes and blockFinder showed poor performance. DMRcate showed poor power in the simulated datasets and low specificity in the real data analysis. Our method showed very high performance in all simulation settings, even with small sample sizes and subtle methylation changes, while controlling type I error. Other advantages of our method are: 1) it estimates the degree of association between the DMR and the outcome; 2) it can analyze a targeted or region of interest; and 3) it can evaluate the simultaneous effects of different variables. The proposed methodology is implemented in MEAL, a Bioconductor package designed to facilitate the analysis of methylation data. We propose a multivariate approach to decipher whether an outcome of interest alters the methylation pattern of a region of interest. The method is designed to analyze large target genomic regions and outperforms the three most popular methods for detecting DMRs. Our method can evaluate factors with more than two levels or the simultaneous effect of more than one continuous variable, which is not possible with the state-of-the-art methods.",breast_neoplasms

A total of 63 non-metastatic TNBC patients who underwent surgical resection were retrospectively investigated from 2007 to 2016 in Inje University Busan Paik Hospital. Pathological tests revealed that 12 patients (19.0%) had LVI. Approximately 61.9% (n = 39) of the patients' samples stained positive for p53. Additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) were performed in 53 (84.1%) and 47 (74.6%) patients, respectively. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months (range, 5.9 to 123.0 months). The pathological T stage (p = 0.008), N stage (p = 0.014), and p53 positivity (p = 0.044) were associated with LVI. Overall, the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 85.4% and 90.2%, respectively. Ten patients (15.9%) experienced relapse. LVI (n = 12) was associated with relapses (p = 0.016). p53 positivity was correlated with poor DFS (p = 0.048). Furthermore, LVI was related to poor DFS (p = 0.011) and OS (p = 0.001) and considered as an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.039). The 3-year DFS of patients with LVI (n = 12) was only 58.3%. Adjuvant RT minimized the negative prognostic effect of LVI on DFS (p = 0.068 [with RT] vs. p = 0.011 [without RT]). LVI was related to the detrimental effects of disease progression and survival of TNBC patients. Thus, a more effective treatment strategy is needed for TNBC patients with LVI.",breast_neoplasms

This retrospective study included 7 FAs, 10 benign PTs (BPTs), 4 borderline PTs, and one malignant PT. Biexponential analyses of IVIM were performed using a 3 T MRI scanner. Quantitative IVIM parameters [pure diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*), and fraction (f)] were calculated. The ADC was also calculated using monoexponential fitting. The D and ADC values showed an increasing tendency in the order of FA, BPT, and borderline or malignant PT (BMPT). No significant difference was found in the D value among the three groups. The ADC value of the BMPT group was significantly higher than that of the FA group (p = 0.048). The D* value showed an increasing tendency in the order of BMPT, BPT, and FA, and the D* value of the BMPT group was significantly lower than that of the FA group (p = 0.048).

A combinatorial approach using immunotherapy with other treatment modalities may decrease side effects while maintaining maximal therapeutic effect. We aimed to determine if bacterial immunotherapy in combination with a chemotherapeutic would be efficacious and less toxic than conventional chemotherapy in an established, preclinical, autochthonous tumor model. BALB-neuT mice develop autochthonous mammary neoplasms that resemble closely the aggressive Her2-driven cancer found in human patients. Virulence-attenuated S. Typhimurium was used for bacterial immunotherapy. Doxorubicin was the chemotherapeutic agent used at the maximum tolerated dose (5?mg/kg) and low dose (1.25?mg/kg). S. Typhimurium was administered intravenously on day 0 and doxorubicin on days 0, 7, and 14. Experiments concluded on day 35. Mammary pad tumors were measured weekly to ascertain efficacy, and mice were weighed weekly to evaluate toxicity. Mice administered maximum tolerated dose doxorubicin (5?mg/kg) demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in tumor size by day 35 and showed a nearly 25% weight loss by day 14 revealing severe toxicity. When mice were administered a single dose of S. Typhimurium combined with a low dose of doxorubicin (1.25?mg/kg), tumors increased <3-fold by day 35, and mice showed only 5% weight loss, indicating no clinically relevant toxicity.

The prognosis of IMPC compared with that of IDC remains controversial; we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic difference between IMPC and IDC. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases for relevant studies comparing overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), relapse-free survival (RFS), local-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) or distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates between IMPC and IDC. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were utilized based on the heterogeneity of the eligible studies. Heterogeneity was further evaluated by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Fourteen studies with 1888 IMPC patients were included in the meta-analysis. The summarized odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated to estimate the prognostic difference between IMPC and IDC. IMPC patients showed an unfavorable prognosis for RFS (OR; 2.04; 95% CI: 1.63-2.55) and LRRFS (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.90-4.17) compared with IDC.

Realtime PCR was used to quantify miR-212-5p expression levels in 30 paired TNBC samples and adjacent normal tissues. Wound healing and Transwell assays were used to evaluate the effects of miR-212-5p expression on the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Luciferase reporter and Western blot assays were used to verify whether the mRNA encoding Prrx2 is a major target of miR-212-5p. MiR-212-5p was downregulated in TNBC, and its expression levels were related to tumor size, lymph node status and vascular invasion in breast cancer. We also observed that the miR-212-5p expression level was significantly correlated with a better prognosis in TNBC. Ectopic expression of miR-212-5p induced upregulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of vimentin expression. The expression of miR212-5p also suppressed the migration and invasion capacity of mesenchymal-like cancer cells accompanied by a morphological shift towards the epithelial phenotype. Moreover, our study observed that miR-212-5p overexpression significantly suppressed Prrx2 by targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) region, and Prrx2 overexpression partially abrogated miR-212-5p-mediated suppression.

After discontinuation of hormonal contraception, the risk of breast cancer was still higher among the women who had used hormonal contraceptives for 5 years or more than among women who had not used hormonal contraceptives. Risk estimates associated with current or recent use of various oral combination (estrogen-progestin) contraceptives varied between 1.0 and 1.6. Women who currently or recently used the progestin-only intrauterine system also had a higher risk of breast cancer than women who had never used hormonal contraceptives (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33). The overall absolute increase in breast cancers diagnosed among current and recent users of any hormonal contraceptive was 13 (95% CI, 10 to 16) per 100,000 person-years, or approximately 1 extra breast cancer for every 7690 women using hormonal contraception for 1 year. The risk of breast cancer was higher among women who currently or recently used contemporary hormonal contraceptives than among women who had never used hormonal contraceptives, and this risk increased with longer durations of use; however, absolute increases in risk were small.

29205355,"Breast angiosarcoma (AS) accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers. The goal of this study was to determine patient outcomes in radiation-associated angiosarcoma of the breast (RAAS) and sporadic AS. We evaluated patterns of recurrence and predictors of breast AS survival. Patients with pathologically confirmed AS from 1994 to 2014 referred to Mount Sinai Hospital/Princess Margaret Cancer Centre were included. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), clinicopathologic characteristics, patterns of recurrence and factors predictive of survival. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used for OS and DFS. Twenty-six patients were included: 6 with sporadic AS and 20 with RAAS. Median follow-up was 24 months. Five-year OS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 44% and 40%, respectively (P?=?ns). Five-year DFS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 23% and 20%, respectively (P?=?ns). Overall recurrence rate was 67% with median time to recurrence of 11 months. Age, tumor depth, margin status, and tumor size were not statistically significant predictive factors for OS and DFS. Breast AS is associated with poor survival and high recurrence rates. Prognosis may be mainly determined by its aggressive biology. Referral to tertiary care centers for multimodality treatment is recommended.",breast_neoplasms
29205144,"Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast includes a heterogeneous group of neoplasms characterized by admixture of adenocarcinoma with area of squamous, chondroid and osseous differentiation. If the tumor shows pure squamous differentiation, it is designated as squamous carcinoma. SCCB accounts for less than 1% of all invasive breast carcinoma. It can present as cystic lesions and simulate a breast abscess. A 75-year old woman was visited at our General Surgery Unit for a palpable lump, about 5 cm in size, at the lower inner quadrant of right breast. Mammography revealed 3cm oval opacity with micro calcifications and US appearance as isoechogenic lump with lesion solid-cystic appearance; cytology deposes for cystic inflammatory lesion(C2) to be monitored. A subsequent ultrasound check one year later confirmed an increase of volume, so micro histology sampling was made with suspect malignancy(B4). After biopsy, the patient underwent excision of cyst. Final histological examination showed SCCB with diffuse positivity for Cytokeratin 34beta-E12 and p63; negative reactions to ER and PR; monoclonal antibody Ki67 > 40%; HER2/neu with score 2+ and FISH examination negative. Subsequently, the patient underwent radical Madden mastectomy which confirmed the histological diagnosis and the negativity of the lymph nodes. In literature, prognosis and therapy are still discussed; SCCB has shown very little responsiveness to common chemotherapy. A quadrantectomy or a radical mastectomy with lymph node dissection must be considered the best treatment for this rare neoplasia.",breast_neoplasms
29205077,"Over the past 40 years the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) has made significant contributions to improve outcome and to make treatment of patients with early breast cancer more tolerable through nationwide and international trials evaluating loco-regional and systemic treatments. These trials have been instrumental to establish standards for the treatment of early breast cancer. The DBCG 82 trials had a global impact by documenting that the significant gain in loco-regional recurrence from postmastectomy radiation added to systemic therapy was associated with a reduction in distant recurrence and mortality in high-risk pre- and postmenopausal patients. The DBCG trials comparing breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy with mastectomy and more recently the trial of internal mammary node irradiation also had a major impact of practice. The trials initiated by the DBCG 40 years ago on tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy became instrumental for the development of adjuvant systemic therapy not only due to their positive results but by sharing these important data with other members of the Early Breast Cancer Trialist' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). Trials from the DBCG have also been important for highlighting the relative importance of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, DBCG has made a major contribution to the development of aromatase inhibitors and targeted adjuvant treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancers. The substantial impact of these treatment improvements is illustrated by a 46.7% 10-year overall survival of early breast cancer patients treated in 1978-1987 compared to 71.5% for patients treated 2008-2012. The trials conducted and implemented by the DBCG appear to have a major impact on the substantial survival improvements in breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29204847,"Several regimens for which efficacy was established in randomized controlled trials are recommended in current treatment guidelines for early breast cancer. However, knowledge on use and effectiveness of commonly administered chemotherapeutic agents in real-life care and across all breast cancer subtypes is limited. The prospective, multicentre German TMK cohort study (Tumour Registry Breast Cancer) recruited patients in 148 oncology outpatient-centres. Data from 1650 patients who completed adjuvant chemotherapy were analysed regarding treatment regimens and taxane use from 2007 to 2014. The association of patient characteristics with application of taxane-free regimens was examined with a multivariate regression model. The preferred adjuvant treatment shifted from fluorouracil, anthracycline and cyclophosphamide containing regimens to anthracycline/taxane combinations. Taxane use increased for all subtypes, and the greatest rise was among node-negative patients. Older age, node-negativity, lower grading, HR-positive/HER2-negative subtype and earlier start year of therapy were significantly associated with taxane-free therapy. Treatment with anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy in Germany has been rising for every subtype. The increased taxane use reflects updated guideline recommendations over the past decade. Cohort studies like the TMK provide insight into real-life treatment of patients outside of clinical trials.",breast_neoplasms
29202668,"In recent years, the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has improved with more effective therapies applicable to a wider range of patients. To many patients, a MBC diagnosis thus initiates a prolonged course of illness and treatment. This qualitative study aimed to explore the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and support needs in MBC patients of all ages in the Danish context. Eighteen MBC patients participated in five qualitative focus group interviews that were analyzed using content analysis and a constructivist approach. The participants described how MBC severely reduced their physical and psychosocial functioning and required a constant adaptation of their quality of life (QoL) standards in relation to their changing life situation and disease progression. Overall, they felt medically well-treated but lacked a multidisciplinary approach to care including psychological support, in particular, but also manual physiotherapy, health care coordination and social counseling. The participants called for continuity of care with the same health care professionals as this facilitated communication and flexibility in planning treatment and controls. They requested a reduction of precious time spend on treatment to enable them to focus on their most meaningful relations and activities. With the MBC diagnosis, the focus of treatment switches from disease eradication to prolonging survival, alleviating symptoms and improving QoL. To patients, MBC marks a shift in expectations from quantity to quality of life and a perpetual adaptation of their QoL standards. To sustain patients' HRQoL, it is important that along with improvements in life-prolonging treatment, comprehensive care also supports their main psycho-social needs. These patients needed support in maintaining normality and role functioning enabling them to focus on living, not merely surviving, through this prolonged disease phase.",breast_neoplasms
29202645,"While comorbidity indices are useful for describing trends in survival, information on specific comorbidities is needed for the clinician advising the individual breast cancer patient on her treatment. Here we present an analysis of overall survival, breast cancer-specific mortality, and effect of medical adjuvant treatment among breast cancer patients suffering from 12 major comorbidities compared with breast cancer patients without comorbidities. The study population was identified from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group and included 59,673 women without prior cancer diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in Denmark from 1990 to 2008 with an estimated median potential follow-up of 14 years and 10 months. Information on comorbidity and causes of death was derived from population-based registries. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of comorbidities on mortality, all-cause and breast cancer specific, using patients without comorbidity as reference. At breast cancer diagnosis, 16% of patients had comorbidities and 84% did not. Compared with the latter, the risk of dying from all causes was significantly increased for all types of comorbidity, but the risk of dying from breast cancer was significantly increased only for peripheral vascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver, and renal diseases. Comorbidities diagnosed within 5 years of breast cancer diagnosis correlated with a greater risk of dying than comorbidities diagnosed more than 5 years before breast cancer diagnosis. With a few exceptions, the effect of adjuvant treatment on breast cancer mortality was similar among patients with and without comorbidity. Breast cancer mortality was not significantly elevated for patients with prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer disease, and diabetes. The similar effect of adjuvant treatment in patients with and without comorbidity underlines the importance of adhering to guideline therapy.",breast_neoplasms
29202622,"In 2011, the St. Gallen Consensus Conference introduced the use of pathology to define the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes by application of immunohistochemical (IHC) surrogate markers ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 with a specified Ki67 cutoff (>14%) for luminal B-like definition. Reports concerning impaired reproducibility of Ki67 estimation and threshold inconsistency led to the initiation of this quality assurance study (2013-2015). The aim of the study was to investigate inter-observer variation for Ki67 estimation in malignant breast tumors by two different quantification methods (assessment method and count method) including measure of agreement between methods. Fourteen experienced breast pathologists from 12 pathology departments evaluated 118 slides from a consecutive series of malignant breast tumors. The staining interpretation was performed according to both the Danish and Swedish guidelines. Reproducibility was quantified by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Lights Kappa with dichotomization of observations at the larger than (>) 20% threshold. The agreement between observations by the two quantification methods was evaluated by Bland-Altman plot. For the fourteen raters the median ranged from 20% to 40% by the assessment method and from 22.5% to 36.5% by the count method. Light's Kappa was 0.664 for observation by the assessment method and 0.649 by the count method. The ICC was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86) by the assessment method vs. 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.87) by the count method. Although the study in general showed a moderate to good inter-observer agreement according to both ICC and Lights Kappa, still major discrepancies were identified in especially the mid-range of observations. Consequently, for now Ki67 estimation is not implemented in the DBCG treatment algorithm.",breast_neoplasms
29202620,"The influence of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on the evaluation of immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker expression may affect the analytical validity of new biomarkers substantially and hence compromise the clinical utility. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of intra-tumoral heterogeneity as well as inter-observer variability on the evaluation of various IHC markers with potential prognostic impact in breast cancer (BCL2, E-cadherin, EGFR, EMMPRIN and Ki-67). From each of 27 breast cancer patients, two tumor-containing paraffin blocks were chosen. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity was evaluated (1) within a single tumor-containing paraffin block ('intra-block agreement') by comparing information from a central, a peripheral tissue microarray (TMA) core and a whole slide section (WS), (2) between two different tumor-containing blocks from the same primary tumor ('inter-block agreement') by comparing information from TMA cores (central/peripheral) and WS. IHC markers on WS and TMA cores were evaluated by two observers independently, and agreements were estimated by Kappa statistics. For BCL2, E-cadherin and EGFR, an almost perfect intra- and inter-block agreement was found. EMMPRIN and Ki-67 showed a more heterogeneous expression with moderate to substantial intra-block agreements. For both stainings, there was a moderate inter-block agreement that improved slightly for EMMPRIN, when using WS instead of TMA cores. Inter-observer agreements were found to be almost perfect for BCL2, E-cadherin and EGFR (WS: ¥ê?>?0",breast_neoplasms

Here, we examine the ability of Prosigna for predicting DR at 10 years in a subgroup of postmenopausal breast cancer patients with special histological subtypes. Using the population based Danish Breast Cancer Group database, follow-up data were collected on all patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2003 with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) normal breast cancer who by nationwide guidelines were treated with 5 year of endocrine therapy (N?=?2558). Among patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes or a tumor size >20?mm, we identified 1570 with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 89 with special histological subtypes (apocrine, medullary, mucinous, papillary, secretory, tubular, neuroendocrine) who were tested with Prosigna. Fine and Gray models were applied to determine the prognostic value of the Prosigna-PAM50 ROR score for DR special subtypes as compared to IDC. Median follow-up for DR was 9.2 year and for OS 15.2 year. The 10-year DR rate for the special subtypes was 9.2% (95% CI: 4.0% to 17.2%) as compared to 13.7% (95% CI: 11.9% to 15.7%) for IDC. The 10-year OS was 74.2% (95% CI: 63.7% to 82.0%) for the special subtypes and 75.4% (95% CI: 73.2% to 77.4%) for IDC. Prosigna showed a statistical significant association of the continuous ROR score with risk of DR for both IDC and the special subtypes (IDC: p?<?.0001; special subtypes: p?=?.01). In the present study, we demonstrated that Prosigna-PAM50 continuous ROR score added significant prognostic information for 10-year DR in postmenopausal patients with special subtypes (tumor size >20?mm or 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes) and ER-positive, HER2-normal early breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29197746,"Radiation therapy plays a major role in the management of adjuvant breast cancer with nodal involvement, with an iatrogenic increase of cardio-vascular risk. Photon therapy, even with intensity modulation, has the downsides of high mean heart dose and heterogeneous target coverage, particularly in the case of internal mammary irradiation. This systematic review of the literature aims to evaluate proton therapy in locally advanced breast cancer. PubMed was searched for original full-text articles with the following search terms: ?Proton Therapy? and ?Breast Cancer?. On-going trials were collected using the words ""Breast Cancer"" and ""Protons"". 13 articles met the criteria: 6 with passive proton therapy (Double Scattering), 5 with Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) and 2 with a combination of both. Proton therapy offered a better target coverage than photons, even compared with intensity modulation radiation therapy (including static or rotational IMRT or tomotherapy). With proton therapy, volumes receiving 95% of the dose were around 98%, with low volumes receiving 105% of the dose. Proton therapy often decreased mean heart dose by a factor of 2 or 3, i.e. 1?Gy with proton therapy versus 3?Gy with conventional 3D, and 6?Gy for IMRT. Lungs were better spared with proton therapy than with photon therapy. Cutaneous toxicity observed with double scattering is improved with PBS. Proton therapy reduces mean heart dose in breast cancer irradiation, probably reducing late cardio-vascular toxicity. Large clinical studies will likely confirm a clinical benefit of proton therapy.",breast_neoplasms

We included autopsy studies of women with no history of breast pathology, which included systematic histological examination of at least one breast, and which allowed calculation of the prevalence of incidental breast cancer or precursor lesions. Data were pooled using logistic regression models with random intercepts (non-linear mixed models). We included 13 studies from 1948 to 2010, contributing 2363 autopsies with 99 cases of incidental cancer or precursor lesions.

This multicenter cross-sectional study enrolled 254 Chinese breast cancer patients in different stages and treatment phases. They answered standard instruments assessing QOL (EORTC), somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), health-related anxiety (WI-7), illness perception (BIPQ), and sense of coherence (SOC-9). Canonical correlation was applied to identify the strongest correlates between the physical, emotional and social QOL scales and the physical and psychological variables. In our sample, a low global QOL was significantly associated with the following physical and psychological variables: symptom-related disability (Karnofsky Index) (r?=?.211, p?<?.01), somatic symptom severity (r?=?-.391, p?<?.001), depression (r?=?-.488, p?<?.001), anxiety (r?=?-.439, p?<?.001), health-related anxiety (r?=?-.398, p?<?.001), dysfunctional illness perception (r?=?-.411, p?<?.001), and sense of coherence (r?=?.371, p?<?.001). In the canonical correlation analysis, high somatic symptom severity, depression, anxiety, dysfunctional illness perception, and low sense of coherence showed the strongest correlations with low physical, emotional and social functioning. The first three significant canonical correlations between these two sets of variables were .78, .56, and .45. QOL in Chinese breast cancer patients is strongly associated with psychological factors. Our results suggest that Chinese physicians and nurses should incorporate these factors into their care for women with breast cancer to improve patients' QOL.",breast_neoplasms

EPClin and PREDICT were determined for every tumour, and the results were compared. Using EPClin scores performed on 120 tumours, the cohort was stratified into low- (n=60) and high-risk (n=60) groups leading to 50% reduction in total chemotherapy prescriptions. PREDICT differentiated the patients into low- (n=45), intermediate- (n=33), and high-risk groups (n=42). Discordance between scores was demonstrated for 50 (41.66%) tumours. Nine (20%) out of 45 patients with low PREDICT scores had high EPClin scores and would otherwise not have received chemotherapy if the NHS PREDICT tool had been used alone. Eight (19%) out of 42 patients at high risk by PREDICT were reclassified as being at low risk by EPClin and avoided adjuvant chemotherapy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for NHS PREDICT to predict the potential need for chemotherapy as determined by EPClin were 85%, 51%, 68% and 80%, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to compare EPClin and PREDICT. The data indicate that computational algorithms such as NHS PREDICT may not accurately predict the need for chemotherapy leading to overtreatment, undertreatment or uncertainty and anxiety in a significant proportion of patients.

Post-excision ultrasound was performed for the evaluation of lesion whether visualized or absent with localizing needle in situ, lesion dimensions, depth measurement between the superior margin of the lesion and its edge. All 54 lesions were present on post-exicison scan, out of which 28 were documented as malignant and 26 as benign. Ultrasound declared all specimens as tumor-free. On histopathology, two lesions were documented as having tumor-positive margins and were proven to be invasive lobular carcinoma.

In addition, discriminant validity was evaluated by the ability of the scale to differentiate between patients who differed in disease stage. T",breast_neoplasms
29182397,"BRCA1/2 mutations account for 30-50% of hereditary breast cancers and bilateral oophorectomy is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in these patients. Breast density is a well-established breast cancer risk factor and is also associated with increased risk in BRCA carriers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of oophorectomy on mammographic breast density and to assess which method of breast density assessment is more sensitive to change over time. Retrospective study of 50 BRCA1/2 patients who underwent bilateral oophorectomy and had at least a baseline and post-surgery mammogram. Mammographic breast density was determined by Volpara and consensus visual assessment by two radiologists. The primary endpoint was change in density between baseline and the first mammogram post-surgery. At baseline, there was a non-significant trend for decreased density with increasing age. Volumetric breast density (VBD) significantly decreased after oophorectomy from a median VBD of 12.5% at baseline to 10.2% post-surgery which was driven by a reduction in fibroglandular volume. There was a higher absolute decrease in VBD in patients aged between 40-50 (p < 0.01). Using Volpara Density Grades (analogous to BI-RADS 4th edition density categories), 84% of females displayed a decrease in density category over the study period compared to only 76% using the radiologists' visual classification (p < 0.001) Conclusion: Oophorectomy is associated with a decrease in breast density and younger patients exhibit a larger absolute decrease. Volpara is more sensitive to identify change over time compared to visual assessment. Advances in knowledge: Oophorectomy is associated with a significant decrease in VBD in patients with BRCA mutations and Volpara Density Grades were more sensitive to identify decreases in density compared to visually assessed BI-RADS categories. Decreases in breast density following oophorectomy surgery in BRCA patients may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the observed decreased breast cancer risk after surgery. However, further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between breast density, oophorectomy and breast cancer risk in BRCA patients.",breast_neoplasms

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cancer in patients who had microdochectomy for pathological nipple discharge in a population in South Africa and to evaluate patients' demographics and clinical characteristics as indicators of underlying cancer and make recommendations for their management in resource-limited settings. Clinical, radiological, and histological data from 153 patients who underwent a microdochectomy for a pathological nipple discharge at two South African breast clinics was collected. Invasive or in situ cancer was found in 12 patients (7.84%), and in all patients, cancer was associated with a bloody nipple discharge. Bloody discharge had a sensitivity of 100% in indicating cancer, specificity of 55.32%, positive predictive value of 16%, and negative predictive value of 100%. Patients with breast cancer were also more likely to be aged 55?y or older (P?=?0.04). Preoperative mammogram and ultrasound were poor in detecting cancer (0/12). In our population, a bloody discharge in women aged 55?years or older should mandate a microdochectomy, with selective surgery for younger women and those with nonbloody discharges. Thorough clinical examination to determine the true color and nature of the discharge is vital in the initial assessment of these patients. Preoperative radiology is not helpful in determining the presence of cancer (in an isolated pathological nipple discharge), and microdochectomy still remains the gold standard in diagnosing cancer in these patients.",breast_neoplasms

The aim was to evaluate the role of health policy in the burden of breast cancer in Brazil between 2004 and 2014. Secondary analysis was performed in 2017 with Brazilian Health Ministry official data, extracted from the Department of Informatics of the National Health System. Age-standardized mortality and the age-standardized incidence of hospital admission by breast cancer were calculated per 100,000 people. Public healthcare costs were converted to US dollars. Regression analysis was performed to estimate the trend of breast cancer rates and healthcare costs, and principal component analysis was performed to estimate a cost factor. Stata¢ç 11.0 was utilized. Between 2004 to 2014, the age-standardized rates of breast cancer mortality and the incidence of hospital admission and public healthcare costs increased.

We previously indicated that knockdown of Neuropilin 1(NRP-1) could inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. Here, we continue exploring the roles and mechanisms of VEGF-A/NRP-1 axis in breast CSCs formation. qRT-PCR was used to detect the levels of VEGF-A and NRP-1 in breast cancer sphere cells and wild-type cells. Mammospheres formation, flow cytometry, soft agar colony and tumor formation assays were performed to evaluate the effects of VEGF-A/NRP-1 on breast cancer stemness. Further HUVECs tube formation, cell invasion assays were carried out to detect the effects of VEGF-A/NRP-1 on breast cancer spheres-induced angiogenesis. Finally, Annexin V/PI apoptosis and CCK8 assays were used to detect the effects of VEGF-A/NRP-1 on chemoresistance. Overexpression of VEGF-A or NRP-1 conferred CSCs-related traits in MCF-7 cells, while knockdown of VEGF-A or NRP-1 reduced CSCs-related traits in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo. Notably, VEGF-A acted in a NRP-1 dependent way. Mechanistically, the VEGF-A/NRP-1 axis conferred CSCs phenotype via activating Wnt/¥â-catenin pathway. our results suggest that VEGF-A/NRP-1 axis could confer CSCs-related traits and chemoresistance.",breast_neoplasms

The authors assessed the impact of autologous breast reconstruction on body mass index patterns after diagnosis in mastectomy patients. Women undergoing therapeutic mastectomy at the authors' institution from 2008 to 2010 were identified. Patients undergoing no breast reconstruction or autologous breast reconstruction were propensity-matched by age at diagnosis, baseline obesity, mastectomy laterality, and adjuvant therapies. Multivariable regression was used to estimate covariate associations with percentage body mass index change and percentage body mass index change greater than 5.0 percent at 1 to 4 years after diagnosis. Of 524 total patients, 80 propensity-matched pairs were identified. In multivariable regression, women undergoing immediate autologous breast reconstruction had reduced body mass index changes after diagnosis, compared with nonreconstruction patients, at 1 year (¥â = -5.25 percent; p < 0.01), 2 years (¥â = -8.78 percent; p < 0.01), and 3 years (¥â = -7.21 percent; p < 0.01). After 4 years, all autologous reconstruction was predictive of reduced body mass index changes (¥â = -3.54 percent; p = 0.02). Higher body mass index increases were observed among women who were leaner at diagnosis (p < 0.01 at 1 year) and received chemotherapy (p = 0.02 at 3 years; p = 0.04 at 4 years). Women undergoing autologous breast reconstruction gained less weight after diagnosis than nonreconstruction patients. Normal baseline body mass index and chemotherapy were predictive of greater body mass index increases.

The mRNA, miRNA (MicroRNA) and lncRNA (Long non-coding RNA) expression profiles were examined using NGS (next generation sequencing) instrument Illumina HiSeq-2500. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses were performed to identify the biological functions of differentially expressed coding RNAs. Subsequently, we constructed an mRNA-ncRNA (non-coding RNA) targeting regulatory network. Finally, we performed RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative PCR) to confirm the NGS results. There are sharp distinctions of the coding and non-coding RNA profiles between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Among the mRNAs and ncRNAs with the most differential expression, SLPI, SOD2, miR-7, miR-143 and miR-145 were highly expressed in MCF-7 cells, while CD55, KRT17, miR-21, miR-10b, miR-9, NEAT1 and PICSAR were over-expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Differentially expressed mRNAs are primarily involved in biological processes of locomotion, biological adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction pathway and focal adhesion. In the targeting regulatory network of differentially expressed RNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs are primarily associated with tumour metastasis, but the functions of lncRNAs remain uncharacterized. These results provide a basis for future studies of breast cancer metastasis and drug resistance.",breast_neoplasms

Prognosis is an important factor for the decision-making process and needs to be precise in order to adjust the intensity of therapy. The Tokuhashi score is a universal instrument to determine the prognosis. The objective was to analyze the effectiveness of the Tokuhashi score in determining the prognosis of the patients with spine metastasis by comparing the expected survival time from the Tokuhashi score with the survival time observed among surgical patients. This retrospective study was performed from October 2008 to October 2015. The inclusion criteria were symptomatic patients with spinal metastasis who underwent spinal cord decompression and had a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The exclusion criteria were patients without histologic confirmation and were lost to follow-up. The Tokuhashi score was applied, and once the expected survival was defined, it was compared with the survival time observed in the follow-up. The sample studied was 117 patients. The commonly female (58%) and breast spinal metastasis was often observed (25.6%). The patients were followed for a minimum period of 12 months. The actual survival was beyond that estimated by the Tokuhashi score (P < 0.05). The Tokuhashi score was not reliable to predict the prognosis. Patients with lower scores that surgical treatment was not recommended by the Tokuhashi score had better quality of life and longer survival after surgery. Tokuhashi score is not a precise tool to establish the best therapy and survival in patients with spinal metastasis.",breast_neoplasms

Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate family members lived experience when a family member is diagnosed with breast cancer. The study had a hermeneutic phenomenological design including individual conversational interviews conducted face-to-face with six women with breast cancer and their family members at two different points of time, in order to elucidate families' lived experience, both as individuals and as a unit, from each family member's perspective. Living as a family in the presence of breast cancer is a challenging endeavour to regain an ordinary, safe life, hoping to reach a safe haven. The families felt that life as they knew it had disappeared and they were fumbling in the dark, trying to find support and guidance on their path to ordinary life. The family members were pursuing balance by attempting to keep the family together and maintaining a positive attitude while battling against fear and treatment-related side effects. Finally, the families were struggling with guilt and inadequacy, due to their difficulties in communicating the emotional distress that the illness brought upon them, at the same time as they felt abandoned by the healthcare professionals. Families experience an unmet need of information and support, which implies that healthcare professionals may want to acknowledge and include the family already at the time of diagnosis in order to help them endure and cope with the distressing experience and thus increase their wellbeing.",breast_neoplasms

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and initially identified 1060 studies. One hundred twenty-two studies remained after exclusions. Most studies utilized a two-level structure; census tracts were the most commonly used geographic scale. Socioeconomic factors, health care access, racial/ethnic factors, and rural-urban status were the most common contextual factors addressed in multilevel models. Breast and colorectal cancers were the most common cancer types, and screening and staging were the most common outcomes assessed in these studies. Opportunities for future research include deriving contextual factors using more rigorous approaches, considering cross-classified structures and cross-level interactions, and using multilevel modeling to explore understudied cancers and outcomes.",breast_neoplasms

It will provide an effective approach for controlled release of the peptide toxins to treat cancerous cells. The ALA fusion proteins were expressed in pichia pastoris, and the recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The proteins were added to human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) in order to investigate the characteristic of selective targeting and releasing of scorpion toxin AGAP in cancer cells with high uPAR expression. The inhibitory effect of ALA on MDA-MB-231, MCF7, LO2 and HEK-293 was evaluated by MTT assay. Moreover, the antiproliferation mechanism of ALA was determined by flow cytometric and western blot analysis. The results showed that ALA could target MDA-MB-231 cells and the scorpion toxin AGAP could be released with high efficiency and selectivity. ALA inhibited the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells MDA-MB231. Also, cell apoptosis pathway was found to be associated with the inhibition mechanism of ALA according to the data of flow cytometric and western blot analysis. Therefore, ALA could be a novel antitumor candidate for targeting treatment of malignant cell. This study successfully demonstrated that fusion of biotoxins with tumor target domain could provide a simple yet effective way to delivery of peptide or protein drugs.",breast_neoplasms

All patients with a needle biopsy -based suspicion of an intraductal papilloma who consequently underwent a BLES procedure at Helsinki University Hospital between 2011 and 2016 were included in this retrospective study. The purpose of the BLES procedure was either to excise the entire lesion or in few cases to achieve better sampling. In total, 74 patients underwent 80 BLES procedures. Pathological diagnosis after the BLES biopsy confirmed an intraductal papilloma?without atypia in 43 lesions, whereas 10 lesions were upgraded to high-risk lesions (HRL) with either atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Five cases were upgraded to malignancy, two were invasive ductal carcinomas and three were ductal carcinoma in situ. Additionally, 18 lesions were diagnosed as other benign lesions. Four procedures failed. Complete excision with BLES was achieved in 19 out of 43 intraductal papillomas, 6 out of 10 HRL and two out of five malignant lesions. No major complications occurred. The BLES procedure was adequate in the management of the 71 breast lesions. The BLES procedure is an acceptable method for the management of small benign and high-risk breast lesions such as intraductal papillomas in selected patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether this remains true when more extensive tumor characteristics and treatment data were included. The cohort included patients registered after primary surgery for early invasive breast cancer in the database of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, in the period 1995-2012. The cohort was divided into three groups: (i) patients who primarily had a mastectomy, (ii) patients treated by BCS, and (iii) patients who primarily had BCS and then mastectomy [intention to treat (ITT) by BCS]. The association between overall mortality and standard mortality ratio (SMR) and risk factors was analyzed in univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models. A total of 58,331 patients were included: 27,143 in the mastectomy group, 26,958 in the BCS group, and 4230 in the BCS-ITT group. After adjusting for patient and treatment characteristics, the relative risk (RR) was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.15-1.25) after mastectomy and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01-1.15) after BCS first and then mastectomy, as compared to BCS. Statistically significant interactions were not observed for age, period of treatment, and nodal status, but patients with Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) score 2+ had no increased mortality after mastectomy, as opposed to patients with CCI 0-1. Loco-regional radiation therapy (RT) in node positive patients did not reduce the increased risk associated with mastectomy [RR?=?1.28 (95% CI 1.19-1.38)]. Patients assigned to BCS have a better survival than patients assigned to mastectomy. Residual confounding after adjustment for registered characteristics presumably explained the different outcomes, thus consistent with selection bias. Diversities in RT did not appear to explain the observed difference in survival after BCS and mastectomy.",breast_neoplasms
29168430,"Treatment of breast cancer has been increasingly successful in recent years with the advent of HER2-receptor targeted treatment and endocrine treatment. However, the triple negative subgroup of breast cancer (TNBC) (estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2-receptor negative) still lacks targeted treatment options. TNBC is a type of breast cancer that often affects younger women, and generally has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Recently, the complex role of the immune system in cancer growth, elimination and metastasis has been the object of increased attention. There is hope that a more detailed understanding of the intricate roles of the constituents of the immune system, will hold potential both as prognostic or predictive markers of cancer progression, but also as treatment targets for a wide range of tumors, including TNBC. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the cellular immune microenvironment in TNBC, and to highlight areas in which TNBC may differ from other types of breast cancer. A search of PubMed was made using the terms 'triple negative breast cancer' and 'tumor infiltrating lymphocytes', 'CD8', 'CD4', 'B cells', 'natural killer cells', 'macrophages', myeloid derived suppressor cells', 'dendritic cells', 'immune check point inhibitor', 'CTLA-4' and 'PD-L1'. We find that whilst factors such as TILs and certain subgroups of TILs (e.g., CD8?+?and regulator T-cells) have been extensively researched, none of these markers are currently applicable to routine clinical practice. Also, TNBC differs from other types of breast cancer with regards to cellular composition of the immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression, and the prognostic significance of these. Immune-related factors have the potential as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers for new treatments targeting the immune system in breast cancer. However, multivariate analyses, taking other well-known factors into account, are required to determine the true value of these biomarkers. Also, differences between TNBC and other types of breast cancer may have implications for treatment and use of immune-related factors as biomarkers.",breast_neoplasms

Here, we report the results obtained by neoadjuvant letrozole in patients with early breast cancer in a phase-II design. A total of 119 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative operable breast cancer were assigned to four months of neoadjuvant letrozole before definitive surgery. Sentinel node or diagnostic fine needle aspiration cytology procedure was performed prior to treatment and the women were assessed prior, at two months, and before surgery with clinical examination, mammography and ultrasonography. Surgical specimens were examined for pathological response. Primary outcome was pathological and clinical response. The per protocol population consisted of 112 patients. Clinical response was evaluated in 109 patients and pathological response in 108. Overall a mean decrease in tumor size was 15% (p?¡Â?.0001). One patient had complete pathological response and 55% of patients had partial pathological response. ER at 100%, ductal subtype, tumor size below 2?cm and lymph node-negative status was significantly associated with a better response to NET and malignancy grade 3 with a poorer response to NET. One patient progressed during treatment and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Eight patients received adjuvant chemotherapy due to lack of response.

Body mass index (BMI) > 30 was noted in 15.4% of prepectoral and 18% of partial subpectoral patients. Radiation therapy was delivered to 38.5% of prepectoral patients and to 22% of partial subpectoral patients. Mean follow-up was 8.7 and 13 months for the prepectoral cohort and partial subpectoral cohorts. The percentage of patients having at least 1 adverse event was 20.5% in the prepectoral and 22% in the partial subpectoral cohorts. The incidence of surgical-site infection and seroma was 8.1% and 4.8%, respectively, for the prepectoral cohort and 4.8% and 2.4%, respectively, for the partial subpectoral cohorts. Device explantation was 6.5% for the prepectoral and 7.2% for the partial subpectoral patients. Explantation did not occur in patients who had radiation or who had a BMI > 30. Four patients (6 breasts-7.2%) required conversion from partial subpectoral to prepectoral because of animation deformity. Prepectoral reconstruction is a viable alternative to partial subpectoral reconstruction. Proper patient selection is an important variable.

We evaluated the clinical benefits of molecular subtyping compared to our current diagnostic practice. Molecular subtyping was performed on a consecutive and unselected series of 524 tumors from women with primary breast cancer (n?=?508). Tumors were classified by the 256 gene expression signature (CIT) and compared to conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures. More than 99% of tumors were eligible for molecular classification and final reports were available prior to the multidisciplinary conference. Using a prognostic standard mortality rate index (PSMRi) developed by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) 39 patients were assigned with an intermediate risk and among these 16 (41%) were furthermore diagnosed by the multi-gene signature assigned with a luminal A tumor and consequently spared adjuvant chemotherapy. There was overall agreement between mRNA derived and IHC hormone receptor status, whereas IHC Ki67 protein proliferative index proved inaccurate, compared to the mRNA derived index. Forty-one patients with basal-like (basL) subtypes were screened for predisposing mutations regardless of clinical predisposition. Of those 17% carried pathogenic mutations. Transcriptome based subtyping of breast tumors evidently reduces the need for adjuvant chemotherapy and improves identification of women with predisposing mutations.

To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters are more effective than talc pleurodesis in reducing total hospitalization days in the remaining lifespan of patients with malignant pleural effusion. This open-label, randomized clinical trial included participants recruited from 9 centers in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Hong Kong between July 2012 and October 2014; they were followed up for 12 months (study end date: October 16, 2015). Patients (n?=?146) with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion who had not undergone indwelling pleural catheter or pleurodesis treatment were included. Participants were randomized (1:1) to indwelling pleural catheter (n?=?74) or talc pleurodesis (n?=?72), minimized by malignancy (mesothelioma vs others) and trapped lung (vs not), and stratified by region (Australia vs Asia). The primary end point was the total number of days spent in hospital from procedure to death or to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included further pleural interventions, patient-reported breathlessness, quality-of-life measures, and adverse events. Among the 146 patients who were randomized (median age, 70.5 years; 56.2% male), 2 withdrew before receiving the randomized intervention and were excluded. The indwelling pleural catheter group spent significantly fewer days in hospital than the pleurodesis group (median, 10.0 [interquartile range [IQR], 3-17] vs 12.0 [IQR, 7-21] days; P?=?.03; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of difference, 2.92 days; 95% CI, 0.43-5.84). The reduction was mainly in effusion-related hospitalization days (median, 1.0 [IQR, 1-3] day with the indwelling pleural catheter vs 4.0 (IQR, 3-6) days with pleurodesis; P?<?.001; Hodges-Lehmann estimate, 2.06 days; 95% CI, 1.53-2.58). Fewer patients randomized to indwelling pleural catheter required further ipsilateral invasive pleural drainages (4.1% vs 22.5%; difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 7.7%-29.2%). There were no significant differences in improvements in breathlessness or quality of life offered by indwelling pleural catheter or talc pleurodesis. Adverse events were seen in 22 patients in the indwelling pleural catheter group (30 events) and 13 patients in the pleurodesis group (18 events). Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter vs talc pleurodesis resulted in fewer hospitalization days from treatment to death, but the magnitude of the difference is of uncertain clinical importance.

To review our series of cutaneous metastatic lesions, analyse their frequency according to patient gender, histotype, localization of the primary tumour, and site of cutaneous metastasis, and correlate this data with clinicopathological parameters. We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of cutaneous metastases from visceral neoplasms diagnosed in our dermatopathology department from July 2003 to February 2017. We registered clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical data. Additional immunohistochemical staining panels were elaborated to confirm or identify the origin of the primary tumour, or at least to specify the histological subtype. We identified 45 histological diagnoses of cutaneous and mucocutaneous metastases. The primary tumour that was most likely to metastasize to the skin was breast cancer. Most cases of breast (89%) and lung cancer (86%) metastasized to the trunk. Of the lesions, 57.5% were nodules and 32.5% were plaques, more frequently multiple (64.4%). In 58% of cases, a metastasis was clinically suspected. Histological examination most frequently revealed an adenocarcinoma, sometimes suggestive of the site of origin.

In this study, MSCs extracted from the skin connective tissue were investigated as transporters of semiconductor nanocrystals quantum dots (QDs). Cytotoxicity of carboxylated CdSe/ZnS QDs was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase cell viability assay. Quantitative uptake of QDs was determined by flow cytometry; their intracellular localization was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In vitro tumor-tropic migration of skin-derived MSCs was verified by Transwell migration assay. For in vivo migration studies of QD-loaded MSCs, human breast tumor-bearing immunodeficient mice were used. QDs were found to be nontoxic to MSCs in concentrations no more than 16 nM. The uptake studies showed a rapid QD endocytosis followed by saturating effects after 6 h of incubation and intracellular localization in the perinuclear region. In vitro migration of MSCs toward MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and their conditioned medium was up to nine times greater than the migration toward noncancerous breast epithelial cells MCF-10A. In vivo, systemically administered QD-labeled MSCs were mainly located in the tumor and metastatic tissues, evading most healthy organs with the exception being blood clearance organs (spleen, kidneys, liver). Skin-derived MSCs demonstrate applicability in cell-mediated delivery of nanoparticles. The findings presented in this study promise further development of a cell therapy and nanotechnology-based tool for early cancer diagnostics and therapy.",breast_neoplasms

Completed phase III RCTs evaluating new drugs in common cancers between January 2005 and October 2016 were identified from ClinicalTrials.gov. Lay media reporting was identified by searching LexisNexis Academic. Scientific reporting was defined as presentation at an academic conference or publication in full. Associations between reporting in the lay media before scientific reporting and study design and sponsorship were evaluated using logistic regression. Of 180 RCTs identified, 52% were reported in the lay media and in 27%, lay media reporting occurred before scientific reporting with an increasing trend over time (p = 0.009). Reporting in the lay media before scientific reporting was associated with positive results (OR: 2.10, p = 0.04), targeted therapy compared to chemotherapy (OR: 4.75, p = 0.006), immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy (OR: 7.60, p = 0.02), and prostate cancer compared to breast cancer (OR: 3.25, p = 0.02).

Family caregiving is essential for patients with life-limiting illnesses to receive palliative care at home, however little information is available regarding potential interventions to achieve palliative homecare for those without sufficient support from family members in various settings, including disasters. In March 2011, Fukushima, Japan experienced an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. In August 2015, a 59-year-old Japanese female presented to our hospital, located 23?km north of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, with a right breast ulcer. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. The patient's general condition gradually worsened despite a one-year course of chemotherapy, and she became bedridden after a fall in October 2016. Although the patient wished to receive palliative homecare, this appeared challenging to achieve because she resided alone in a temporary housing shelter. Although she originally lived with her family in Odaka District, Fukushima, she relocated outside of the city following evacuation orders after the disaster. The evacuation orders for Odaka District were still in effect when she returned to the city alone in 2014. We contacted her sister who moved apart from her during the evacuation, and explained the necessity of family caregiving to enable her palliative homecare. The sister decided to move back to their original residence in Odaka District and live with the patient again. The patient successfully spent her end-of-life period and died at home. Health care providers and community health workers may need to take a pro-active approach to communicating with family members to draw informal support to enable patients' end-of-life management according to their values and preferences.

Here we report an unusual case of a 30-year-old HIV-positive woman with BL and cavernous sinus syndrome who also had intense bilateral breast uptake, related to menstrual cycle. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has been found to be useful in the management of BL. A 30-year old female patient presented with a history of diplopia and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large cavernous sinus mass. A bone marrow biopsy was done and demonstrated extensive marrow infiltration by Burkitt lymphoma. Further investigation detected the Epstein-Barr virus in her cerebrospinal fluid using qualitative polymerase chain reaction. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging done revealed a hypermetabolic cavernous sinus mass, conglomerates of enlarged pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes as well as diffuse bone marrow uptake. Intense bilateral breast uptake was noted coinciding with the start of menses. She was started on chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy. After her first cycle of chemotherapy, repeat 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging revealed a marked reduction in the metabolic activity and size of the cavernous sinus mass and conglomerates of lymph nodes. The bone marrow activity was still visualized but less intense compared to the staging PET/CT. A cavernous sinus mass will rarely be the primary lesion in Burkitt's Lymphoma. Our case demonstrates the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the assessment of such cases to detect other primary areas of disease involvement.

In recent years, various studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the regulation of cancer development and progression. Here, we explored the role of lncRNAs in Huaier-induced tumor suppression. Microarray profiling was performed to identify the candidate lncRNAs affected by Huaier extract. Quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) was used to evaluate the transfection efficiency and the influence of Huaier extract on H19 expression. The effect of Huaier extract on the cell viability was examined by MTT. Moreover, the rates of apoptotic cells were detected using flow-cytometric analysis. Western blot analysis was applied to show the protein levels of CBL. Microarray data derived from Huaier-treated breast cancer cells identified H19 as a potential target. Huaier extract reduced the expression of H19. The over-expression of H19 inhibited the cytotoxic effects of Huaier extract; in contrast, reduced H19 expression enhanced the function of Huaier extract. MiR-675-5p was identified as a mature product of H19. Moreover, Huaier extract reduced the miR-675-5p expression. Upregulating miR-675-5p reversed the inhibitory effects of Huaier extract, whereas downregulating miR-675-5p sensitized breast cancer cells to the effect of Huaier extract. In addition, Huaier extract increased the expression of CBL protein, a direct target of miR-675-5p.

29144159,"To evaluate the ability of shear-wave elastography (SWE) to distinguish between benign and malignant palpable masses of the adult male breast. Clinical examination, mammography, B-mode and Doppler ultrasound findings and SWE quantitative parameters were compared in 50 benign lesions (including 40 gynaecomastias) and 15 malignant lesions (invasive ductal carcinomas) from 65 patients who were consecutively addressed for specialized advice at our comprehensive cancer centre. Mean elasticity (El mean), maximum elasticity (El max), El mean of the surrounding fatty tissue and lesion to fat ratio (El ratio) were reported for each patient. Malignant masses displayed significantly higher El mean (p < 0.0001), El max (p < 0.0001) and El ratio (p < 0.0001) compared to benign masses without overlap of values between the two groups. By adding SWE to clinical examination, mammography and ultrasound, all the lesions would have been retrospectively correctly diagnosed as benign or malignant. One false positive could have been downstaged, 14/65 undetermined masses could have been correctly reclassified as 4 malignant and 10 benign lesions, for which biopsies could have consequently been avoided. Evaluation of male breast palpable masses by SWE demonstrates that malignant masses are significantly stiffer lesions and may improve diagnostic management when clinical examination, mammography and conventional ultrasound are doubtful. Advances in knowledge: Quantitative SWE is feasible in male breast and could be of great interest to help classify doubtful lesions after classical clinical and radiological evaluations, probably because of different anatomy and different tumours epidemiology compared with female breast.",breast_neoplasms

29138131,"Symptom distress in patients toward the end of life can change rapidly. Family caregivers have the potential to help patients manage those symptoms, as well as their own stress, if they are equipped with the proper resources. Electronic health (eHealth) systems may be able to provide those resources. Very sick patients may not be able to use such systems themselves to report their symptoms but family caregivers could. The aim of this paper was to assess the effects on cancer patient symptom distress of an eHealth system that alerts clinicians to significant changes in the patient's symptoms, as reported by a family caregiver. A pooled analysis from two randomized clinical trials (NCT00214162 and NCT00365963) compared outcomes at 12 months for two unblinded groups: a control group (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]-Only) that gave caregivers access to CHESS, an online support system, and an experimental group (CHESS+CR [Clinician Report]), which also had CHESS but with a CR that automatically alerted clinicians if symptoms exceeded a predetermined threshold of severity. Participants were dyads (n=235) of patients with advanced lung, breast, or prostate cancer and their respective family caregivers from 5 oncology clinics in the United States of America. The proportion of improved patient threshold symptoms was compared between groups using area-under-the-curve analysis and binomial proportion tests. The proportion of threshold symptoms out of all reported symptoms was also examined. When severe caregiver-reported symptoms were shared with clinicians, the symptoms were more likely to be subsequently reported as improved than when the symptoms were not shared with clinicians (P<.001). Fewer symptom reports were completed in the group of caregivers whose reports went to clinicians than in the CHESS-Only group (P<.001), perhaps because caregivers, knowing their reports might be sent to a doctor, feared they might be bothering the clinician. This study suggests that an eHealth system designed for caregivers that alerts clinicians to worrisome changes in patient health status may lead to reduced patient distress.

We searched electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, through January 2017 using the following keywords: ""triple negative breast cancer,"" ""TNBC,"" and ""random*"" without language restrictions. The major outcome in the present analysis was the overall response rate (ORR), and the secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A network meta-analysis and multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression were used to compare antitumor regimens. We included 35 articles assessing a total of 8476 TNBC patients in our systematic review. The regimen of Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel (78.2%) was the most likely to improve the ORR in TNBC patients, followed by EndoTAG-1 and Paclitaxel (69.7%), Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (65.0%), and Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel (61.8%). In the patients without metastasis, the regimen of Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel (74.9%) remained the most likely to improve the ORR. We could not analyze the results for patients with metastasis or outcomes of PFS and OS because no >4 regimens formed a network.

Brain tumors are highly deadly, and unfortunately not many improvements have been achieved to improve the survival of patients with brain tumors. Chemoradiation resistance is one of the most clinically relevant challenges faced in patients with brain tumors. The perivascular niche is one of the most relevant microenvironment hubs in brain tumors. The understanding of the cellular crosstalk established within the brain tumor perivascular niche might provide us with key discoveries of new brain tumor vulnerabilities. Radio and chemoresistance in GBM and brain metastases is attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs), which intrinsically modulate several pathways that make them resistant to therapy. Growing evidence, however, highlights the perivascular space as a niche for CSC survival, resistance to therapy, progression and dissemination. Here, I review the latest discoveries on the components and features of brain tumor vascular niches and the possible therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting its vulnerabilities, thus preventing GBM and metastasis chemoradiation resistance and recurrence.

This study enrolled 91 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer that was clinically node negative with a tumor size <3 cm. We compared SLN identification rates between HEMS and conventional methods (gamma probe scanning using a colloidal radioisotope [RI] and a blue dye method) by analyzing the relationships of lymphatic to axillary lesions and SLNs. The identification rate of SLNs was 100% using HEMS, 97.8% using the RI method, and 95.6% using the blue dye method. Two types of lymphatic pathway (LP) were detected in 39 patients (42.9%) and also clearly identified using HEMS-captured color and NIR fluorescence. The incidence of two or more SLNs was significantly higher in patients with a two-route LP to the axilla group than in those with only one route (p < 0.001; 43.6 vs. 9.6%).

Data on incident cases of colorectal, lung, female breast, and prostate cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 were obtained from a population-based cancer registry covering a population of approximately 2.5 million people in the West of Scotland. Socio-economic circumstances were assessed based on postcode of residence at diagnosis, using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). For each cancer, crude and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated by quintile of SIMD score, and the number of excess cases associated with socio-economic deprivation was estimated. 93,866 cases met inclusion criteria, comprising 21,114 colorectal, 31,761 lung, 23,757 female breast, and 15,314 prostate cancers. Between 2001 and 2006, there was no consistent association between socio-economic circumstances and colorectal cancer incidence, but 2006-2012 saw an emerging deprivation gradient in both sexes. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for colorectal cancer between most deprived and least deprived increased from 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.16) to 1.24 (95% CI 1.11-1.39) during the study period.

Breast and prostate cancer showed an inverse relationship with socio-economic circumstances, with lower incidence among people living in more deprived areas. Significant socio-economic inequalities remain in cancer incidence in the West of Scotland, and in some cases are increasing. In particular, this study has identified an emerging, previously unreported, socio-economic gradient in colorectal cancer incidence among women as well as men.

Accumulation of new clinical data has compelled us to update the analysis. Randomized trials comparing different anti-HER2 regimens in the neoadjuvant setting were included, and odds ratio for pathologic complete response (pCR) in seven treatment arms were assessed by pooling effect sizes. Direct and indirect comparisons using a Bayesian statistical model were performed. All statistical tests were two-sided. A database search identified 993 articles with 13 studies meeting the eligibility criteria, including three new studies with lapatinib (lpnb). In an indirect comparison, dual anti-HER2 agents with CT achieved a better pCR rate than other arms. The credibility intervals of CT?+?tzmb?+?lpnb arm were largely reduced compared to our former report, which we added sufficient clinical evidence by this update. Values of surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) suggested that CT?+?tzmb?+?pzmb had the highest probability of being the best treatment arm for pCR, widening the difference between the top two dual-HER2 blockade arms compared to our former report. The overall consistency with our first report enhanced the credibility of the results. Network meta-analysis using new clinical data firmly establish that combining two anti-HER2 agents with CT is most effective against HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

Analysis looking at odd ratios for both 5-year and 10-year for DFS and OS showed similar results. EGFR-overexpression appears to be associated with reduced OS and DFS in women with early breast cancer. Patients with triple negative and EGFR-overexpression have poorer OS and DFS than those with triple negative tumors and normal EGFR expression.",breast_neoplasms
29124429,"Acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia (AEIP) is a leading cause of death after lung cancer resection in patients with interstitial lung disease. We retrospectively analyzed 1763 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) who underwent lung cancer resection between 2000 and 2009 at 61 hospitals in Japan. AEIP occurred in 164 of 1763 (9.3%) patients with a mortality rate of 43.9% (72/164). Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify possible risk factors of fatal AEIP. We then analyzed the 164 patients who developed postoperative AEIP and identified the preoperative and postoperative risk factors. A multivariate regression analysis identified that the sex, percent vital capacity, neoadjuvant radiation, preoperative history of AEIP, preoperative use of steroids, usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on CT, and surgical procedures were independent preoperative risk factors for death due to AEIP. ILD patients with emphysema somehow showed a lower risk of fatal AEIP than those without emphysema in this study. This study revealed eight risk factors for fatal AEIP.",breast_neoplasms
29121911,"Obesity is part of the established risk factors for breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal females. Circulating leptin increases in parallel with the increase of body weight and fat reservoir. This research investigated the link between leptin phenotype and the clinicopathological factors in BC. A large set of breast cancer cases (449), and 27 non-cancerous tissue samples of breast were employed for leptin expression recognition using immunohistochemistry staining. Cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining of leptin was recognized in 376 (83.7%) and 25 (92.6%) of BC and control cases respectively. Leptin immunostaining were significantly associated with age, histotypes, grade, stage, lymph node involvement, tumor recurrence, hormone receptor phenotypes, ER and HER2 expressions, and p-values were (P?=?0.0233), (P?=?0.0001), (P?=?0.050), (P?=?0.0291), (P?=?0.0300), (P?=?0.0023), (P?=?0.0021), (P?=?0.0279) respectively. Reasonable proportion of cases with low staining score was more prevalent in all subgroups of clinicopathological parameters except ER- PR+ HER2- hormone receptor phenotype and mucinous carcinoma which showed high level of leptin immunoreactivity. Tumor recurrence is less prevailing in high score leptin immunostaining cases. Furthermore, Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test findings revealed considerably different survival distributions were observed for the different categories of leptin immunostaining scores (P?=?0.032). Negative leptin immunostaining is related to poor survival. Our preliminary findings support leptin clinical value in confirming BC diagnosis as well as prognosis. These results suggest that leptin molecule is an important biomarker that could identify type, grade, stage, lymph node involvement, relapse and prognosis in breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29121049,"8-oxoG, a common DNA lesion resulting from reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been shown to be associated with cancer initiation. hOGG1 DNA glycosylase is the primary enzyme responsible for excision of 8-oxoG through base excision repair (BER). Integrins are members of a family of cell surface receptors that mediate the cell-cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Integrins are involved in almost every aspect of carcinogenesis, from cell differentiation, cell proliferation, metastasis to angiogenesis. Loss of ITGA2 expression was associated with enhanced tumor intravasation and metastasis of breast and colon cancer. XPD gene encodes DNA helicase enzyme that is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). It is shown in previous research that XPD homozygous wildtype Lys/Lys genotype was associated with higher odds of NPC. We conducted a 1 to N case-control study involving 300 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases and 533 controls matched by age, gender and ethnicity to investigate the effect of hOGG1 Ser326Cys, ITGA2 C807T and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms on NPC risk. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were conducted to explore the association of allele combinations with NPC risk. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) was used for DNA genotyping. No significant association was observed between hOGG1 Ser326Cys and ITGA2 C807T polymorphisms with NPC risk after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, cigarette smoking, alcohol and salted fish consumption. Lys/Lys genotype of XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism was associated with increased NPC risk (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.06-2.43). Subjects with history of smoking (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26-2.60), and salted fish consumption before age of 10 (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.30-2.42) were observed to have increased odds of NPC. The odds of developing NPC of CGC haplotype was significantly higher compared to reference AGC haplotype (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.06-4.58). The allele combination of CGC from hOGG1, ITGA2 and XPD polymorphisms was significantly associated with increased odds of NPC.",breast_neoplasms
29120834,"Cervical cancer incidence in the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPIs) is double that of the US mainland. American Samoa, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam and the Republic of Palau receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) to implement cervical cancer screening to low-income, uninsured or under insured women. The USAPI grantees report data on screening and follow-up activities to the CDC. We examined cervical cancer screening and follow-up data from the NBCCEDP programs in the four USAPIs from 2007 to 2015. We summarized screening done by Papanicolaou (Pap) and oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, follow-up and diagnostic tests provided, and histology results observed. A total of 22,249 Pap tests were conducted in 14,206 women in the four USAPIs programs from 2007-2015. The overall percentages of abnormal Pap results (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse) was 2.4% for first program screens and 1.8% for subsequent program screens. Histology results showed a high proportion of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (57%) among women with precancers and cancers. Roughly one-third (32%) of Pap test results warranting follow-up had no data recorded on diagnostic tests or follow-up done. This is the first report of cervical cancer screening and outcomes of women served in the USAPI through the NBCCEDP with similar results for abnormal Pap tests, but higher proportion of precancers and cancers, when compared to national NBCCEDP data. The USAPI face significant challenges in implementing cervical cancer screening, particularly in providing and recording data on diagnostic tests and follow-up. The screening programs in the USAPI should further examine specific barriers to follow-up of women with abnormal Pap results and possible solutions to address them.",breast_neoplasms
29120826,"Cancer disparities within and across populations provide insight into the influence of lifestyle, environment, and genetic factors on cancer risk. Guam cancer incidence and mortality were compared to that of Hawaii using data from their respective population-based, central cancer registries. In 2009-2013, overall cancer incidence was substantially lower in Guam than in Hawaii for both sexes while overall cancer mortality was higher for Guam males. Cervical cancer incidence and prostate cancer mortality were higher in Guam. Both incidence and mortality were higher among Guam men for cancers of the lung & bronchus, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, and nasopharynx; Chamorro men were disproportionately affected by these cancers. Filipinos and Whites in Guam had lower overall cancer incidence compared to Filipinos and Whites in Hawaii. Although breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in Guam compared to Hawaii, women in Guam presented at younger ages and with rarer disease histologies such as inflammatory carcinoma were more prevalent. Guam patients were also diagnosed at younger ages for cancers of bladder, pancreas, colon & rectum, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, lung & bronchus, stomach, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. Smoking, infectious agents, and betel nut chewing appear to be important contributors to the burden of cancer in Guam. Earlier onset of cancer in Guam suggests earlier age of exposure to key risk factors and/or a more aggressive pathogenesis. Contrasting cancer patterns within Guam and between Guam and Hawaii underscore the potential influence of genes, lifestyle, and environmental factors on cancer development and progression.",breast_neoplasms
29119589,"The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical value of ultrasound (US) features of breast lesions for predicting the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer. In this retrospective study, 425 patients with breast cancer were recruited, and their preoperative US features and postoperative pathologic results were collected. The association of these US features of breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastasis was determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Among the 425 patients, 200 (47.1%) had axillary lymph node metastasis, and 225 (52.9%) did not. The parameters of tumor shape, color Doppler flow imaging grades, histologic grade, and E-cadherin level were significantly and independently associated with axillary lymph node metastasis (P?<?.05 for all). Axillary lymph node metastasis was prone to happen in patients with US features of an irregular tumor shape and higher color Doppler flow imaging grades. Ultrasound imaging provides a promising tool for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29117498,"The administration of endocrine therapy for 5 years substantially reduces recurrence rates during and after treatment in women with early-stage, estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Extending such therapy beyond 5 years offers further protection but has additional side effects. Obtaining data on the absolute risk of subsequent distant recurrence if therapy stops at 5 years could help determine whether to extend treatment. In this meta-analysis of the results of 88 trials involving 62,923 women with ER-positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 5 years of scheduled endocrine therapy, we used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, stratified according to trial and treatment, to assess the associations of tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), tumor grade, and other factors with patients' outcomes during the period from 5 to 20 years. Breast-cancer recurrences occurred at a steady rate throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status. Among the patients with stage T1 disease, the risk of distant recurrence was 13% with no nodal involvement (T1N0), 20% with one to three nodes involved (T1N1-3), and 34% with four to nine nodes involved (T1N4-9); among those with stage T2 disease, the risks were 19% with T2N0, 26% with T2N1-3, and 41% with T2N4-9. The risk of death from breast cancer was similarly dependent on TN status, but the risk of contralateral breast cancer was not. Given the TN status, the factors of tumor grade (available in 43,590 patients) and Ki-67 status (available in 7692 patients), which are strongly correlated with each other, were of only moderate independent predictive value for distant recurrence, but the status regarding the progesterone receptor (in 54,115 patients) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) (in 15,418 patients in trials with no use of trastuzumab) was not predictive. During the study period from 5 to 20 years, the absolute risk of distant recurrence among patients with T1N0 breast cancer was 10% for low-grade disease, 13% for moderate-grade disease, and 17% for high-grade disease; the corresponding risks of any recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer were 17%, 22%, and 26%, respectively. After 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, breast-cancer recurrences continued to occur steadily throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status, with risks ranging from 10 to 41%, depending on TN status and tumor grade.

29117208,"The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) predicts a clinical benefit of chemotherapy for individuals with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Using in vitro chemoresponse assay, we compared the chemosensitivity according to RS in these patients. Among the patients with Oncotype Dx assay, we identified 63 patients who had chemotherapy response assays to doxorubicin based on adenosine triphosphate. The degree of chemosensitivity to doxorubicin was translated into the cell death rate (CDR). The RS was also dichotomized with a cutoff of 26. Of 63 patients, 34 (54%), 17 (27%), and 12 patients (19%) had a low, intermediate, and high RS, respectively. The mean CDR differed significantly according to categorized RS, with 17.3¡¾10.8 in the low RS group vs. 23.6¡¾16.3 in the intermediate RS group vs. 28.8¡¾12.6 in the high RS group (P = 0.024, One-way ANOVA test).

29116378,"Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in male breast cancer. Thirty consecutive cases of male breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary tumors and matched metastasis were noted. 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of 30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2. Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher's exact test. We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover, the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting.",breast_neoplasms

This study investigates the association between warfarin use and cancer incidence in a large, unselected population-based cohort. To examine the association between warfarin use and cancer incidence. This population-based cohort study with subgroup analysis used the Norwegian National Registry coupled with the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Cancer Registry of Norway. The cohort comprised all persons (N?=?1?256?725) born between January 1, 1924, and December 31, 1954, who were residing in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012. The cohort was divided into 2 groups-warfarin users and nonusers; persons taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were the subgroup. Data were collected from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012. Data analysis was conducted from October 15, 2016, to January 31, 2017. Warfarin use was defined as taking at least 6 months of a prescription and at least 2 years from first prescription to any cancer diagnosis. If warfarin treatment started after January 1, 2006, each person contributed person-time in the nonuser group until the warfarin user criteria were fulfilled. Cancer diagnosis of any type during the 7-year observation period (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012). Of the 1?256?725 persons in the cohort, 607?350 (48.3%) were male, 649?375 (51.7%) were female, 132?687 (10.6%) had cancer, 92?942 (7.4%) were classified as warfarin users, and 1?163?783 (92.6%) were classified as nonusers. Warfarin users were older, with a mean (SD) age of 70.2 (8.2) years, and were predominantly men (57 370 [61.7%]) as compared with nonusers, who had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (8.6) years and were mostly women (613 803 [52.7%]). Among warfarin users and compared with nonusers, there was a significantly lower age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) in all cancer sites (IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and in prevalent organ-specific sites (lung, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75-0.86]; prostate, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.65-0.72]; and breast, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-1.00]). There was no observed significant effect in colon cancer (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.06). In a subgroup analysis of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the IRR was lower in all cancer sites (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.59-0.65) and in prevalent sites (lung, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.33-0.46]; prostate, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.55-0.66]; breast, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87]; and colon, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]).

Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20-39 year-olds, highlighting major patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n=184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income. 975396 new cancer cases and 358392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43·3 new cancer cases per 100000 people per year and 15·9 cancer-associated deaths per 100000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition.

29105051,"Breast-conserving therapy, involving breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation and optionally a boost to the tumour bed, is a standard therapeutic option for women with early-stage breast cancer. A boost to the tumour bed means that an extra dose of radiation is applied that covers the initial tumour site. The rationale for a boost of radiotherapy to the tumour bed is that (i) local recurrence occurs mostly at the site of the primary tumour because remaining microscopic tumour cells are most likely situated there; and (ii) radiation can eliminate these causative microscopic tumour cells. The boost continues to be used in women at high risk of local recurrence, but is less widely accepted for women at lower risk. Reasons for questioning the boost are twofold. Firstly, the boost brings higher treatment costs. Secondly, the potential adverse events are not negligible. In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the effect of the tumour bed boost on local control and side effects. To assess the effects of tumour bed boost radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation for the treatment of breast cancer. We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 1 March 2017), Embase (1980 to 1 March 2017), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 March 2017. We also searched the European Society of Radiotherapy and Oncology Annual Meeting, the St Gallen Oncology Conferences, and the American Society for Radiation Oncology Annual Meeting for abstracts. Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition and the omission of breast cancer tumour bed boost radiotherapy. Two review authors (IK and CW) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool, resolving any disagreements through discussion. We entered data into Review Manager 5 for analysis and applied GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. We included 5 randomised controlled trials analysing a total of 8325 women.Local control appeared to be better for women receiving a tumour bed boost compared to no tumour bed boost (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.75; 5 studies, 8315 women, low-quality evidence). Overall survival did not differ with or without a tumour bed boost (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 2 studies, 6342 women, moderate-quality evidence). Disease-free survival did not differ with or without a tumour bed boost (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.02; 3 studies, 6549 women, low-quality evidence). Late toxicity scored by means of percentage of breast retraction assessment did not differ with or without a tumour bed boost (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.93; 2 studies, 1526 women, very low-quality evidence). Cosmesis scored by a panel was better (i.e. excellent or good compared to fair or poor) in the no-boost group (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.85; 2 studies, 1116 women, low-quality evidence). Cosmesis scored by a physician did not differ with or without a tumour bed boost (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.69; 2 studies, 592 women, very low-quality evidence).We excluded two studies in a sensitivity analysis of local recurrence (because the biological equivalent dose (BED) to the tumour bed was lower, in situ tumours were included, or there was a high risk of selective reporting bias or blinding of outcome assessment bias), which resulted in a HR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.73; 3 studies, 6963 women, high-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis including women older than 40 years of age yielded a HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.81; 2 studies, 5058 women, high-quality evidence).We found no data for the outcomes of acute toxicity, quality of life, or costs. It appears that local control rates are increased with the boost to the tumour bed, but we found no evidence of a benefit for other oncological outcomes. Subgroup analysis including women older than 40 years of age yielded similarly significant results. Objective percentage of breast retraction assessment appears similar between groups. It appears that the cosmetic outcome is worse with the boost to the tumour bed, but only when measured by a panel, not when assessed by a physician.",breast_neoplasms

We integrate available biological knowledge and clinical data regarding cell kinetics of bone marrow granulopoiesis, the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of G-CSF applications (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) into a comprehensive model. The model explains leukocyte time courses of more than 70 therapy scenarios comprising 10 different cytotoxic drugs. It is applied to develop optimized G-CSF schedules for a variety of clinical scenarios. Clinical trial results showed validity of model predictions regarding alternative G-CSF schedules. We propose modifications of G-CSF treatment for the chemotherapies 'BEACOPP escalated' (Hodgkin's disease), 'ETC' (breast cancer), and risk-adapted schedules for 'CHOP-14' (aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in elderly patients). We conclude that we established a model of human granulopoiesis under chemotherapy which allows predictions of yet untested G-CSF schedules, comparisons between them, and optimization of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim treatment. As a general rule of thumb, G-CSF treatment should not be started too early and patients could profit from filgrastim treatment continued until the end of the chemotherapy cycle.",breast_neoplasms

Medical chart review from 2007 to 2016 identified 208 consecutive patients with pure FEA diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy who underwent surgical excision (96.2% [200 of 208]) or had at least 2 years of imaging follow-up (3.8% [8 of 208]). Medical records were reviewed for risk factors and surgical outcomes. Overall upgrade rate of FEA to malignancy was 2.4% (5 of 208). All 5 upgraded cases were ductal carcinoma in situ at operation. The upgrade rate to atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, or atypical lobular hyperplasia was 29.8% (62 of 208). The FEA lesions in patients with a genetic mutation were more likely to upgrade to malignancy than FEA lesions in patients without a genetic mutation (33.3% [1 of 3] vs 2.0% [4 of 205]; p < 0.01). The FEA lesions in patients with a personal history of breast cancer were more likely to upgrade to higher-risk lesions than those without a personal history (47.8% [11 of 23] vs 27.6% [51 of 185]; p?= 0.046) but were not more likely to be upgraded to malignancy (0% [0 of 23] vs 2.7% [5 of 185]; p?= 0.42). The overall risk of upgrade of FEA to malignancy is low at 2.4%; however, the upgrade rate to a higher-risk lesion is nearly 30%. Surveillance rather than surgical excision of FEA can be a reasonable option for patients without a genetic mutation who opt against chemoprevention.",breast_neoplasms

Eribulin mesylate is a halichondrin non-taxane inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. A recent pooled analysis with eribulin showed improved overall survival (OS) in various MBC patient subgroups pretreated with anthracycline and taxane. Furthermore, eribulin may have less neurotoxicity than paclitaxel. This study was a prospective randomised phase II, open-label, two-arm, multicentre study comparing eribulin plus gemcitabine (EG) with PG chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative MBC. We hypothesised that EG chemotherapy would not be inferior to PG chemotherapy. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS), which was estimated to be 70% at 6 months for each arm. The secondary end-points were as follows: OS, neuropathic scale, toxicity?and clinical benefit rate. A total of 118 patients (median age: 50, 24-66) were enrolled between March 2015 and March 2016?and were randomly assigned to PG (n?=?59) or EG (n?=?59) chemotherapy. The mean number of metastatic sites was 3 (range 1-8). The 6-month PFS rates for both arms were 72% for EG and 73% for PG (P?=?0.457). There was no significant difference in OS between the two groups (not reached versus?21.2 months, P?=?0.2234).

The median follow-up was 106?months (range 3-151?months) and 42?months (range 2-115?months) for FBC and MBC, respectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to the hormonal therapy used: TAM-treated and AI-treated. MBC was characterized by older age, advanced tumor stage, and higher rate of lymph node metastases, in comparison with FBC. Matching analysis was performed using six prognostic criteria: patient age, tumor stage, tumor grade, lymph node status, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status, and administration of chemotherapy. The female and male patients were matched 2:1. In this analysis, 316 women and 158 men treated with TAM, and 60 women and 30 men treated with AI, were included. The overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared between FBC and MBC. TAM-treated FBC and MBC patients had similar 5-year OS, 85.1 and 89.2%, respectively (p?=?0.972). Notably, FBC patients treated with AI had significantly greater 5-year OS (85.0%) in comparison with AI-treated MBC patients (5-year OS of 73.3%; p?=?0.028).

Although the time-dependent effect of the oestrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumour has already been described, so far no factor has proven to disentangle the multi-peak behaviour observed for breast cancer recurrences. Here, we aimed at investigating whether adiposity at diagnosis, reflected by increased patient's body mass index (BMI), could be associated with breast cancer recurrence patterns over time after primary cancer therapy. We retrieved BMI from 734 of 777 patients with node-positive breast cancer from a phase III randomised clinical trial, which compared different chemotherapy regimens and had a median follow-up of 15.4 years. Cumulative incidence estimation as well as piecewise exponential models were carried out to estimate the distant recurrence dynamics, in all patients, as well as in subgroups based on the ER status, with the ER-positive group being further split according to the menopausal status. In patients with ER-negative breast cancer, time-dependent analyses revealed that the hazard of late relapses could mainly be attributed to the overweight and obese patients. Within the subgroup of premenopausal patients with ER-positive tumours, obesity was associated with an early high narrow peak of distant recurrences followed by another main peak after 5 years of follow-up. The risk for overweight patients was intermediate between obese and normal-weight patients. In the postmenopausal subgroup of patients with ER-positive tumours, the distant recurrence rate was significantly more elevated in the overweight patients compared to the other BMI categories, and a second late peak of recurrences was also observed for the obese patients. These results demonstrate that the patient's BMI at diagnosis is associated with cancer recurrence dynamics.

Observational study of older women with pathologically node-negative stage I-II invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery in a SEER state in 2008-2009. Surgeon annual volume of breast cancer cases and type of axillary surgery were determined by Medicare claims. An estimated probability of excess lymphedema due to ALND was calculated. Among 7686 pathologically node-negative women, 49% underwent ALND (either initially or after SLNB) and 25% were operated on by low-volume surgeons. Even after adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics, women treated by higher volume surgeons were less likely to undergo ALND [medium volume: odds ratio, 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.82); high volume: odds ratio, 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.76)].

The present study investigated whether breast cancer affected future income among Danish women that participated in the work force. We also examined the roles of sociodemographic factors and prior psychiatric medical treatment. This registry-based cohort study was based on information retrieved from linked Danish nationwide registries. We compared the incomes of 13,101 women (aged 30-59?years) diagnosed with breast cancer (exposed) to those of 60,819 women without breast cancer (unexposed). Changes in income were examined during a 10-year follow-up; for each follow-up year, we calculated the mean annual income and the relative change compared to the income earned one year prior to diagnosis. Expected changes in Danish female income, according to calendar year and age, were estimated based on information from Statistics Denmark. For exposed and unexposed groups, the observed income changes were dichotomized to those above and those below the expected change in income in the Danish female population. We examined the impact of breast cancer on income each year of follow-up with logistic regression models. Analyses were stratified according to educational level, marital status, and prior psychiatric medical treatment. Breast cancer had a temporary negative effect on income. The effect was largest during the first three years after diagnosis; thereafter, the gap narrowed between exposed and unexposed cohorts. The odds ratio for an increase in income in the cancer cohort compared to the cancer-free cohort was 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) after three years. After seven years, no significant difference was observed between cohorts. Stratified analyses demonstrated that the negative effect of breast cancer on income lasted longest among women with high educational levels. Being single or having received psychiatric medical treatment increased the chance to experience an increase in income among women with breast cancer.

We hypothesized that adding FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor functional antagonist, to doxorubicin would potentiate its effects by suppression of drug-induced inflammation. The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus data sets, and National Cancer Institute-60 panel were used for gene expressions and gene set enrichment analysis. E0771 syngeneic mammary tumor cells were used. OB/OB mice fed with western high-fat diet were used as an obesity model. STAT3 expression was significantly increased after doxorubicin treatment in human breast cancer that implicates that doxorubicin evokes inflammation. Expression of sphingosine kinase 1, the enzyme that produces S1P and links inflammation and cancer, tended to be higher in doxorubicin-resistant human cancer and cell lines. In a murine breast cancer model, sphingosine kinase 1, S1P receptor 1, interleukin 6, and STAT3 were overexpressed in the doxorubicin-treated group, whereas all of them were significantly suppressed with addition of FTY720. Combination therapy synergistically suppressed cancer growth both in?vitro and in?vivo. Furthermore, combination therapy showed higher efficacy in an obesity breast cancer model, where high body mass index demonstrated trends toward worse disease-free and overall survival, and high-serum S1P levels in human patients and volunteers.

Peri-operative administration of local anesthesia reduces acute and persistent post-surgical pain, but there is currently no consensus on the optimal method of local anesthetic delivery. Patients undergoing axillary dissection for breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive a one-off dose of levobupivacaine 0.5% (up to 2?mg/kg) following surgery, either via the surgical drain or by direct skin infiltration. Post-operative pain control at rest and on shoulder abduction was assessed using a numerical rating scale. Total analgesia consumption 48?h after surgery was also recorded. Pain scores were significantly lower when local anesthesia was administered via surgical drain at both 3 and 12?h after surgery; this trend extended to 24?h post-operatively. However, pain scores on shoulder abduction did not differ at the 12 or 24 h time points. No differences were found in the total analgesia consumption or length of hospital stay between treatment groups. This study demonstrates that local anesthetic delivery via a surgical drain provides improved pain control compared to direct skin infiltration following axillary node dissection.

Utilising a cohort study design, we aimed to determine the risk of extra-colorectal cancer and to identify yet unrecognised tumour types. Data from 1624 Lynch syndrome mutation carriers in the Danish hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer register were used to estimate the sex- and age-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for 30 extra-colorectal malignancies with comparison to the general population. Significantly increased IRRs were identified for 13 cancer types with differences related to gender, age and disease-predisposing gene. The different cancer types showed variable peak age incidence rates (IRs) with the highest IRs for ovarian cancer at age 30-49 years, for endometrial cancer, breast cancer, renal cell cancer and brain tumours at age 50-69 years, and for urothelial cancer, small bowel cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and skin tumours after age 70. The broad spectrum of tumour types that develop at an increased incidence defines Lynch syndrome as a multi-tumour syndrome.

29061807,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an antimicrobial protein present in milk, saliva, gastric secretions, tears and upper respiratory tract secretions. LPO constitutes an important enzyme of the human immune defense system. However, LPO has also been suggested to be involved in breast cancer etiology through production of reactive free radicals and activation of carcinogenic aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are generally highly lipophilic and thus accumulate in highly fatty breast tissues. The aromatic compounds 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) and 4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (BZ) are known to have carcinogenic properties. LPO catalyzes their oxidation and converts them into reactive products which bind to DNA and form adducts. These DNA adducts subsequently lead to breast cancer. The crystal structure of LPO was obtained from Protein Data Bank. Structures of ABP and BZ were retrieved from PubChem database. Induced Fit Docking was performed using glide module from Schrodinger. The present study reports the structural binding of ABP and BZ with LPO using in silico approaches. The amino acid residues of LPO involved in the binding with the two aromatic ligands were characterized and binding energy values were calculated. Both ABP and BZ were placed in the substrate binding site present in the distal heme cavity of LPO with good affinity. The binding mode mimicked that of the natural substrate since these compounds did not disturb the water molecule that plays an important role in the oxidation reaction. Thus, the water molecule is potentially available for facilitating the subsequent activation of the aromatic amines to reactive species which may form DNA adducts leading to breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

In the present study, we report the in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of 7,8-Diacetoxy-3-arylcoumarin derivatives (5a-h) in human prostate (PC-3) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using crystal violet dye-binding assay. Furthermore, the most active compound in vitro cytotoxic activity in human non-cancerous cell line and its effect on the cell-cycle phases, apoptosis proteins expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Glutathione (GSH) level were performed. Among the eight compounds that were evaluated, 7,8-Diacetoxy-3-(4-methylsulfonyl phenyl)coumarin (5f) was the most active derivative with highest cytotoxic activity and selectivity against the PC-3 cell line vs. the non-cancerous WPE1-N22 cell line. The cytotoxic action of compound 5f in PC-3 cells is associated with the cell-cycle arrest at -G0/G1 phase, apoptosis, loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and depletion of Glutathione (GSH) level.

29059676,"The targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is still challenging due to poor understanding on its molecular etiology. The androgen receptor (AR) has recently emerged as a prognostic and treatment-predictive marker in breast cancer. However, the role of AR in TNBC remained elusive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect AR and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) expression in tissue microarrays of 165 TNBC patients. Microarray analysis of mRNAs was performed to identify downstream regulators of AR. TNBC cells were cultured with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) alone or in combination with AR knockdown performed with AR shRNA. Cell viability and colony formation were assessed. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to examine protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The potential mechanism of AR-mediated GPER suppression was identified by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. AR and GPER expressions were also assessed in nude mouse xenografts by IHC. IHC staining showed that the expression of AR was positively associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and high-grade tumor in TNBC patients. AR activation triggered by DHT suppressed GPER expression, to promote cell growth of TNBC. G-1, a GPER agonist, inhibited DHT-stimulated proliferation. Further experiments illustrated that AR suppressed GPER activation via binding directly to the promoter of GPER. Moreover, a negative correlation between AR and GPER was observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell xenografts and TNBC patient samples. The suppression of GPER via AR may be involved in the positive actions towards the TNBC progression, making it a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",breast_neoplasms

Thus, we studied whether a novel approach using an ERBB1-3-neutralizing antibody mixture can block these compensatory mechanisms of resistance. HER2+ cell lines and xenografts (n e	6 mice per group) were treated with the ERBB1-3 antibody mixture Pan-HER, trastuzumab/lapatinib (TL), trastuzumab/pertuzumab (TP), or T-DM1. Downregulation of ERBB receptors was assessed by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Paired pre- and post-T-DM1 tumor biopsies from patients (n	=	11) with HER2-amplified breast cancer were evaluated for HER2 and P-HER3 expression by immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. ERBB ligands were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Drug-resistant cells were generated by chronic treatment with T-DM1. All statistical tests were two-sided. Treatment with Pan-HER inhibited growth and promoted degradation of ERBB1-3 receptors in a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cells. Compared with TL, TP, and T-DM1, Pan-HER induced a similar antitumor effect against established BT474 and HCC1954 tumors, but was superior to TL against MDA-361 xenografts (TL mean = 2026	mm 3 , SD	=	924	mm 3 , vs Pan-HER mean = 565	mm 3 , SD	=	499?mm 3 , P = .04).

29059428,"Early-stage breast cancer is among the most prevalent and costly malignancies treated in the American health care system. Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy represents a substantial portion of breast cancer expenditures. The relative value of novel radiotherapeutic approaches such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) compared with conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) is unknown. Therefore, we used prospectively collected outcomes from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to compare the cost-effectiveness of these approaches. We constructed a decision-analytic model that followed women who were treated with lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Recurrence, mortality, complication rates, and utilities (five-year radiation-associated quality of life scores), were extracted from RCTs. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness from societal and health care sector perspectives was estimated considering two scenarios-the first assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists five years after treatment, and the second assumes that disutility discontinues. Lifetime outcomes were summarized using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the results. HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI (ie, resulted in higher quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and lower cost) in all scenarios. HF-WBI also had a greater likelihood of cost-effectiveness compared with IORT; under a societal perspective that assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists, HF-WBI results in an ICER of $17?024 per QALY compared with IORT with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 80% at the $100?000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. If radiation-associated disutility is assumed to discontinue, the ICER is lower ($11?461/QALY), resulting in an even higher (83%) probability of relative cost-effectiveness. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of metastasis and treatment cost. For women with early-stage breast cancer requiring adjuvant radiotherapy, HF-WBI is cost-effective compared with CF-WBI and IORT.",breast_neoplasms

So far, identification of potentially affected families in Germany was solely performed via family history and numbers of affected family members with breast or ovarian cancer. However, neither the prevalence of deleterious variants in BRCA1/2 in ovarian cancer in Germany nor the reliability of family history as trigger for genetic counselling has ever been evaluated. Prospective counseling and germline testing of consecutive patients with primary diagnosis or with platinum-sensitive relapse of an invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Testing included 25 candidate and established risk genes. Among these 25 genes, 16 genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PMS2, PTEN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53) were defined as established cancer risk genes. A positive family history was defined as at least one relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer or breast cancer in personal history. In total, we analyzed 523 patients: 281 patients with primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer and 242 patients with relapsed disease. Median age at primary diagnosis was 58 years (range 16-93) and 406 patients (77.6%) had a high-grade serous ovarian cancer. In total, 27.9% of the patients showed at least one deleterious variant in all 25 investigated genes and 26.4% in the defined 16 risk genes. Deleterious variants were most prevalent in the BRCA1 (15.5%), BRCA2 (5.5%), RAD51C (2.5%) and PALB2 (1.1%) genes. The prevalence of deleterious variants did not differ significantly between patients at primary diagnosis and relapse. The prevalence of deleterious variants in BRCA1/2 (and in all 16 risk genes) in patients <60 years was 30.2% (33.2%) versus 10.6% (18.9%) in patients ¡Ã60 years.

Here, we report the effects on apoptosis and autophagy in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines after treatment with cantharidin and attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with cantharidin and cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 and clone formation assays. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins was detected by western blotting. Cells were infected with lentivirus carrying the Beclin-1 gene, and MDA-MB-231-beclin1 (MB231-Bec) and MDA-MB-468-beclin-1(MB468-Bec) cells stably expressing Beclin-1 were established. Autophagic vacuoles in cells were observed with LC3 staining using fluorescence microscopy, and apoptotic cells were detected via flow cytometry. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of TNBC cells into BALB/c nude mice. Cantharidin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Cantharidin additionally inhibited the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and autophagosome formation by suppressing the expression of Beclin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Beclin-1 in TNBC cells attenuated the cytotoxicity of cantharidin. In vivo, cantharidin inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice by suppressing autophagy and inducing apoptosis, and Beclin-1 overexpression in TNBC cells reduced the efficacy of cantharidin.

We investigated LAG-3 expression and its prognostic value in a large series of breast cancer patients, and correlated LAG-3 expression with key biomarkers including PD-1 and PD-L1. LAG-3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on two tissue microarray series incorporating 4322 breast cancer primary excision specimens (N?=?330 in the training and N=?3992 in the validation set) linked to detailed clinicopathologic, biomarker and long-term clinical outcome data. PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Stromal or intra-epithelial tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs or iTILs) expressing LAG-3 or PD-1 were assessed by absolute count. PD-L1 expression was evaluated as the percentage of positive carcinoma cells per core. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analyses. After locking down interpretation cut-offs on the training set, LAG-3+ iTILs were found in 11% of cases in the validation set. In both sets, LAG-3+ iTILs were significantly associated with negative prognostic factors: young age, large tumor size, high proliferation, HER2E and basal-like breast cancer subtypes. In multivariate analyses, breast cancer patients with LAG-3+ iTILs had a significantly improved breast cancer-specific survival [hazard ratio (HR): 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.90], particularly among estrogen receptor-negative patients (HR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.69). Furthermore, we found that 53% of PD-L1+?and 61% of PD-1+?cases were also positive for LAG-3+ iTILs. Concurrent infiltration of LAG-3+ and CD8+ iTILs was significantly associated with increased breast cancer-specific survival (HR: 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.74). LAG-3+ iTILs are enriched in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers and represent an independent favorable prognostic factor.

29037983,"Antibody-drug conjugates have emerged as a powerful strategy in cancer therapy and combine the ability of monoclonal antibodies to specifically target tumour cells with the highly potent killing activity of drugs with payloads too toxic for systemic administration. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (also known as DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against HER2, a novel enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. We assessed its safety and tolerability in patients with advanced breast and gastric or gastro-oesophageal tumours. This was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial done at two study sites in Japan. Eligible patients were at least 20 years old with breast or gastric or gastro-oesophageal carcinomas refractory to standard therapy regardless of HER2 status. Participants received initial intravenous doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan from 0·8 to 8·0 mg/kg and dose-limiting toxicities were assessed over a 21-day cycle; thereafter, dose reductions were implemented as needed and patients were treated once every 3 weeks until they had unacceptable toxic effects or their disease progressed. Primary endpoints included identification of safety and the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dosing and were analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The dose-escalation study is the first part of a two-part study with the second dose-expansion part ongoing and enrolling patients as of July 8, 2017, in Japan and the USA. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900. Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 26, 2016, 24 patients were enrolled and received trastuzumab deruxtecan (n=3 for each of 0·8, 1·6, 3·2, and 8·0 mg/kg doses; n=6 for each of 5·4 and 6·4 mg/kg). Up to the study cutoff date of Feb 1, 2017, no dose-limiting toxic effects, substantial cardiovascular toxic effects, or deaths occurred. One patient was removed from the activity analysis because they had insufficient target lesions for analysis. The most common grade 3 adverse events were decreased lymphocyte (n=3) and decreased neutrophil count (n=2); and grade 4 anaemia was reported by one patient. Three serious adverse events-febrile neutropenia, intestinal perforation, and cholangitis-were reported by one patient each. Overall, in 23 evaluable patients, including six patients with low HER2-expressing tumours, ten patients achieved an objective response (43%, 95% CI 23¡¤2-65¡¤5). Disease control was achieved in 21 (91%; 95% CI 72¡¤0-98¡¤9) of 23 patients. Median follow-up time was 6¡¤7 months (IQR 4¡¤4-10¡¤2), with nine (90%) of ten responses seen at doses of 5¡¤4 mg/kg or greater. The maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan was not reached. In this small, heavily pretreated study population, trastuzumab deruxtecan showed antitumour activity, even in low HER2-expressing tumours. B",breast_neoplasms
29037213,"Due to high survival rates and the relatively small benefit of adjuvant therapy, the application of personalized medicine (PM) through risk stratification is particularly beneficial in early breast cancer (BC) to avoid unnecessary harms from treatment. The new 21-gene assay (OncotypeDX, ODX) is a promising prognostic score for risk stratification that can be applied in conjunction with Adjuvant!Online (AO) to guide personalized chemotherapy decisions for early BC patients. Our goal was to evaluate risk-group specific cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with early stage BC in Austria based on AO and ODX risk stratification. A previously validated discrete event simulation model was applied to a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women over a lifetime horizon. We simulated twelve risk groups derived from the joint application of ODX and AO and included respective additional costs. The primary outcomes of interest were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER). The robustness of results and decisions derived were tested in sensitivity analyses. A cross-country comparison of results was performed. Chemotherapy is dominated (i.e., less effective and more costly) for patients with 1) low ODX risk independent of AO classification; and 2) low AO risk and intermediate ODX risk. For patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk, the ICER is below 15,000 EUR/QALY (potentially cost effective depending on the willingness-to-pay). Applying the AO risk classification alone would miss risk groups where chemotherapy is dominated and thus should not be considered. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence but not to changes in the costs of chemotherapy or the ODX test. Based on our modeling study, chemotherapy is effective and cost effective for Austrian patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk. In other words, low ODX risk suggests chemotherapy should not be considered but low AO risk may benefit from chemotherapy if ODX risk is high. Our analysis suggests that risk-group specific cost-effectiveness analysis, which includes companion prognostic tests are essential in PM.",breast_neoplasms
29035996,"Regarding radioguided surgery, the concept of ""radioguided occult lesion localization"" (ROLL) is based on both preoperative interventional imaging and intraoperative radioguided detection of a clinically occult neoplastic lesion. This methodology consists in the direct administration into the lesion of Tc-macroaggregated human albumin formed by relatively large particles retained at the injection site, which direct radioguided excisional biopsy. This modality has expanded from the classic application of ROLL for nonpalpable breast lesions to other tumors, such as solitary pulmonary nodules or recurrences from differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In 2011, in order to improve the classification of different radioguided surgical procedures, ROLL applications were included in the more complete concept of GOSTT (Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumor Targeting). This concept was introduced to include the entire range of basic and advanced radioguided procedures necessary to supply a ""road map"" for the surgeon. The terms ROLL and GOSTT have further developed by incorporating novel modalities such as hybrid tracers for simultaneous fluorescence and radioactive signal detection and innovative navigation systems based on mixed-reality protocols.",breast_neoplasms
29033071,"Currently, there is no agreement regarding if it would be necessary to perform an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients who have macrometastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). We studied the utility of the secondary node analysis (SN), defined as the following node after the SLN in an anatomical and lymphatic pathway, as a sign of malignant axillary involvement. An observational, retrospective and multicentre study was designed to assess the utility of the SN as a sign of axillary involvement. Among 2273 patients with breast cancer, a valid sample of 283 was obtained representing those who had the SN studied. Main endpoints of our study were: the SLN, the SN and the ALND histological pattern. Sensitivity, specificity and precision of the test were also calculated. SN test, in cases with positive SLN, has a sensitivity of 61.1%, a specificity of 78.7%, a positive predictive value of 45.8% and a negative predictive value of 87.3% with a precision of 74.7%.

Data from ten French cancer registries were used, including data for patients with a first prostate cancer (in males), breast cancer (in females), and colon, lung and kidney cancer (in both sexes) diagnosed between 1989 and 2004. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of SPC were computed by excluding, or not, the risk of an SPC at the same site. For prostate cancer, the SIR dropped from 1.11 to 0.72 when the risk of SPC of the prostate was included. SIRs increased from 1.36 to 1.45, from 1.14 to 1.21, from 1.57 to 2.01, and from 1.37 to 1.51 for breast, colon, lung, and kidney respectively.

29031778,"The effect of extended adjuvant aromatase inhibition in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer after sequential endocrine therapy of tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor for a 5-year treatment period still needs clarification. To address this issue, we began the DATA study to assess different durations of anastrozole therapy after tamoxifen. DATA was a prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 study done in 79 hospitals in the Netherlands. We randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer with no signs of disease recurrence after 2-3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen to either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole treatment (1 mg orally once a day) in a 1:1 ratio. We used TENALEA (Trans European Network for Clinical Trials Services) for the randomisation procedure. Stratification factors were nodal status, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and tamoxifen treatment duration. The primary study endpoint of this analysis was disease-free survival starting beyond 3 years after randomisation (adapted disease-free survival). Here we report the final analysis from the DATA trial, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00301457. Between June 28, 2006, and Aug 10, 2009, we screened 1912 patients of whom 955 were assigned to the 3-year group and 957 to the 6-year anastrozole treatment group. 1860 patients were eligible (931 in the 6-year group and 929 in the 3-year group) and 1660 were disease free 3 years after randomisation.

29029886,"To characterize outcomes of metastatic colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histologies, compared with other radiosensitive histologies, treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery with regard to local control, overall survival, and predictors of response. A total of 127 patients with 148 spine stereotactic radiosurgery-treated metastatic lesions at our institution between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed. We assessed clinical endpoints in relation to histologic type, including local control (LC) and overall survival (OS), using univariate and multivariate analyses. For all patients, the 1- and 2-year actuarial rates for LC were 82.6% and 75.8%, and rates for OS were 72.9% and 51.5% respectively. Among tumor histologies, 1-year cumulative incidence rates of local failure for thyroid, breast, lung, and colon cancer were 8.7%, 7.0%, 26.6%, and 39.6%, respectively. When analyzed together, NSCLC and colorectal cancers had significantly greater cumulative incidence rates at 1 and 2?years (30.4% and 38.7%, respectively) than other histologies (8.0% and 14.1% respectively, P=.0008). Non-small cell lung cancer/colorectal tumor status was a significant predictor of local failure in a competing risk univariate model (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.07-4.17, P=.03) and multivariate model (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.12-4.92, P=.024). Spine stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective strategy in achieving local control of spine metastases, particularly among radiosensitive histologies. However, a subset of these classically defined histologies (NSCLC and colorectal) has a propensity toward local failure. In addition to resulting in poorer OS outcomes, the poor LC rates seen in NSCLC and colorectal cancers in this study are more consistent with a radioresistant phenotype, suggesting the need for optimized dosing regimens in this subgroup.",breast_neoplasms

However, concerns regarding contamination as a cause of false positive results have persisted. We performed PCR assays for MMTV on human breast cancer cell lines and fresh frozen and formalin fixed normal and malignant human breast epithelial samples. Assays were also performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from volunteer blood donors and subjects at risk for human retroviral infections. In addition, assays were performed on DNA samples from wild and laboratory mice. Sequencing of MMTV positive samples from both humans and mice were performed and phylogenetically compared. Using PCR under rigorous conditions to prevent and detect ""carryover"" contamination, we did detect MMTV DNA in human samples, including breast cancer. However, the results were not consistent and seemed to be an artifact. Further, experiments indicated that the probable source of false positives was murine DNA, containing endogenous MMTV, present in our building. However, comparison of published and, herein, newly described MMTV sequences with published data, indicates that there are some very unique human MMTV sequences in the literature. While we could not confirm the true presence of MMTV in our human breast cancer subjects, the data indicate that further, perhaps more traditional, retroviral studies are warranted to ascertain whether MMTV might rarely be the cause of human breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms
29028221,"As costs of cancer care rise, the importance of documenting value in oncology increases. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) has the potential to reduce toxicities in cancer patients, but is relatively expensive and unproven. Evaluating quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is essential to establishing PBT's ""value"" in oncologic therapy. The goal of this systematic review was to assess QOL and PROs in patients treated with PBT. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic searches were conducted. The PubMed search engine was the primary data source, along with publications found from references of selected articles, and articles known to the authors published through 2017. Seventeen original investigations were found to have sufficient focus and relevance to be incorporated into the systematic review. Studies of skull base (n?=?1), brain (n?=?1), head/neck (n?=?1), lung (n?=?1), breast (n?=?2), prostate (n?=?8), and pediatric (n?=?3) malignancies treated with PBT that met eligibility criteria were included. QOL did not deteriorate during PBT for skull base and after PBT for brain tumors, respectively. PROs were higher for PBT than photon-based radiotherapy for both head/neck and lung cancer. Patient-reported breast cosmesis was appropriate after PBT and comparable to photon modalities. PBT in various settings of prostate cancer displayed an expected post-therapy decline; one study showed improved PROs (rectal urgency, bowel frequency) for PBT, and two others showed PROs/QOL comparable with other modalities. Pediatric studies demonstrated improvements in QOL during therapy, with additional increases thereafter. Based on limited data, PBT provides favorable QOL/PRO profiles for select brain, head/neck, lung, and pediatric cancers; measures for prostate and breast cancers were more modest. These results have implications for cost-effective cancer care and prudently designed QOL evaluation in ongoing trials, which are discussed.

Thirty biopsy specimens from triple-negative BC patients who had conventionally received preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery were selected in the investigation. All the selected patients were conventionally assigned to neoadjuvant polychemotherapy (PCT) with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The surgical specimens were analyzed in relation to the degree of a tumor morphological response to PCT. The magnitude of the health-promoting effect of neoadjuvant therapy was evaluated according to the residual cancer burden (RCB) system using an on-line calculator; RCB was categorized into classes (from RCB-0 to RCB-III). The markers CD44, !D24, and tenascin C were identified by the standard immunoperoxidase method in the primary biopsies. Varying morphological responses of triple-negative breast cancer to PCT were revealed, which showed resistance in 60% of the cases. The chemoresistance found in most (87%) cases coincided with the identification of the CD44+/CD24low/- profile. The detection of the higher production of the extracellular matrix tenascin C participating in the formation of the TSC niche fully combined with the CD44+/CD24low/- phenotype; while the maximum response to tenascin C was noted in the cases differing in not only a lack of responses to PCTs, but also in the most aggressive course in conjunction with metastatic disease. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that the unique association between the CD44+/CD24low/- phenotype and the pronounced production of tenascin C may have a prognostic potential, prospectively indicating the inefficiency of neoadjuvant PCT, in particular that with platinum derivatives, which is used for the standard treatment of triple-negative BC.

The molecular mechanisms for distant metastasis and mortality in breast cancer patients with diabetes are not very well understood. We compared the effect of physiological (5?mM) and diabetic (10?mM) levels of glucose on malignant breast epithelial cell invasion and stemness capabilities. We performed microRNA array to determine the dysregulated microRNAs in hyperglycaemic conditions and performed functional and molecular analysis of the gene targets. Hyperglycaemia leads to hyperactivation of cancer stem cell pool and enhances invasive ability of breast cancer cells. MiR-424 seems to be a key regulator of cancer cell stemness and invasion. Knockdown of miR-424 in cancer cells under euglycaemic conditions leads to enhanced invasion and stem cell activity, whereas ectopic expression of miR-424 in cancer cells under hyperglycaemic conditions results in suppressed invasion and stem cell activity. Cdc42, a target of miR-424, influences cancer stem cell activity by positively regulating prdm14 through activation of pak1 (p-21-activated kinase 1) and stat5.

We then compared the diagnostic performance depending on the operator's experience with breast imaging. The sensitivity values for the experienced readers, inexperienced readers, and CAD (for experienced and inexperienced readers) were 91.7%, 75%, 75%, and 66.7%, respectively. The specificity values for the experienced readers, inexperienced readers, and CAD (for experienced and inexperienced readers) were 76.6%, 71.8%, 78.2%, and 76.1%, respectively. When diagnoses were made subjectively in combination with CAD, the specificity significantly improved (76.6% to 80.3%) without a change in the sensitivity (91.7%) in the experienced readers. After subjective combination with CAD, the sensitivity and specificity improved in the inexperienced readers (75% to 83.3% and 71.8% to 77.1%). In addition, the area under the curve improved for both the experienced and inexperienced readers (0.84 to 0.86 and 0.73 to 0.8) after the addition of CAD. CAD is more useful for less experienced readers. Combining CAD with breast US led to improved specificity for both experienced and inexperienced readers.",breast_neoplasms

28988891,"Radiotherapy plays a fundamental role in the treatment of cancer. Currently, the Brazilian public health system cannot match the national radiotherapy demand and many patients requiring radiotherapy are never exposed to this treatment. This study estimated the number of preventable deaths in the public health system if access to radiotherapy was universal. Incidence rates for the year 2016 provided by Instituto Nacional de Cancer were used in this analysis. The number of untreated patients requiring radiotherapy was obtained through the difference between the total number of patients requiring radiotherapy and the total amount of delivered radiotherapy treatments in the public health system. The number of deaths for the three most common cancers in each gender due to radiotherapy shortage was calculated. Initially, the total number of patients per cancer type was divided in stages using Brazilian epidemiological data. Subsequently, previously published tree arm diagrams were used to define the rate of patients requiring radiotherapy in each specific clinical setting. Finally, the clinical benefit of radiotherapy in overall survival was extracted from studies with level 1 evidence. Over 596?000 cancer cases were expected in Brazil in 2016. The public health system covers more than 75% of the Brazilian population and an estimated 111?432 patients who required radiotherapy in 2016 did not receive this treatment. Breast, colorectal and cervix cancers are the most frequent malignant tumours in women and prostate, lung and colorectal in men. The number of deaths due to a radiotherapy shortage in the year 2016 for these types of cancer were: (i) breast: 1011 deaths in 10 years; (ii) cervix: 2006 deaths in 2 years; (iii) lung: 1206 deaths in 2 years; (iv) prostate, intermediate risk: 562 deaths in 13 years; high risk: 298 deaths in 10 years; (v) colorectal: 0 deaths, as radiotherapy has no proven benefit in overall survival. Thousands of cancer patients requiring radiotherapy do not have access to this treatment in the Brazilian public health system. The shortage of radiotherapy has a significant detrimental effect on cancer survival; over 5000 deaths would probably be prevented in the most common cancer types if radiotherapy access was universal.",breast_neoplasms
28988168,"In a randomised controlled trial, we found that informing women about overdetection changed their breast screening decisions. We now present a mediation analysis exploring the psychological pathways through which study participants who received the intervention processed information about overdetection and how this influenced their decision-making. We examined a series of potential mediators in the causal chain between exposure to overdetection information and women's subsequently reported breast screening intentions. Serial multiple mediation analysis within a randomised controlled trial. New South Wales, Australia. 811 women aged 48-50 years with no personal history of breast cancer. Two versions of a decision aid giving women information about breast cancer deaths averted and false positives from mammography screening, either with (intervention) or without (control) information on overdetection. Intentions to undergo breast cancer screening in the next 2-3 years. Knowledge about overdetection, worry about breast cancer, attitudes towards breast screening and anticipated regret. The effect of information about overdetection on women's breast screening intentions was mediated through multiple cognitive and affective processes. In particular, the information led to substantial improvements in women's understanding of overdetection, and it influenced-both directly and indirectly via its effect on knowledge-their attitudes towards having screening. Mediation analysis showed that the mechanisms involving knowledge and attitudes were particularly important in determining women's intentions about screening participation. Even in this emotive context, new information influenced women's decision-making by changing their understanding of possible consequences of screening and their attitudes towards undergoing it. These findings emphasise the need to provide good-quality information on screening outcomes and to communicate this information effectively, so that women can make well-informed decisions.

28987728,"Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006-2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures.",breast_neoplasms
28987700,"To propose a computer-assisted method for quantifying the hardness of an axillary lymph node on real-time elastography (RTE) and its morphology on B-mode ultrasound; and to combine the dual-modal features for differentiation of metastatic and benign axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. A total of 161 axillary lymph nodes (benign, n=69; metastatic, n=92) from 158 patients with breast cancer were examined with both B-mode ultrasound and RTE. With computer assistance, five morphological features describing the hilum, size, shape, and echogenic uniformity of a lymph node were extracted from B-mode, and three hardness features were extracted from RTE. Single-modal and dual-modal features were used to classify benign and metastatic nodes with two computerized classification approaches, i.e., a scoring approach and a support vector machine (SVM) approach. The computerized approaches were also compared with a visual evaluation approach. All features exhibited significant differences between benign and metastatic nodes (p<0.001), with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.803 and the highest accuracy (ACC) of 75.2% for a single feature. The SVM on dual-modal features achieved the largest AUC (0.895) and ACC (85.7%) among all methods, exceeding the scoring (AUC=0.881; ACC=83.6%) and the visual evaluation methods (AUC=0.830; ACC=84.5%). With the leave-one-out cross validation, the SVM on dual-modal features still obtained an ACC as high as 84.5%. Dual-modal features can be extracted from RTE and B-mode ultrasound with computer assistance, which are valuable for discrimination between benign and metastatic lymph nodes. The SVM on dual-modal features outperforms the scoring and visual evaluation methods, as well as all methods using single-modal features. The computer-assisted dual-modal evaluation of lymph nodes could be potentially used in daily clinical practice for assessing axillary metastasis in breast cancer patients.",breast_neoplasms
28987679,"Preoperative assessment of pure Ductal Carcinoma Insitu (DCIS) is essential in the surgical planning. The role of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been debated. The impact of MRI on the management of High Grade (HG) DCIS was assessed, whether it accurately captures the true size of this entity in comparison to conventional imaging, and, if MRI use would reduce the number of re-excision surgery. Ninety-one consecutive patients with HG DCIS, who were identified from a prospectively collected data at Kettering General Hospital between April 2011 and December 2015. All patients had preoperative MRI scan in addition to the standard breast imaging. This was compared to a control group of consecutive patients (n=52) which was obtained from a period just before 2011. Impact on surgical planning and number of surgeries for each patient was compared. The size of HG DCIS estimated by MRI was compared to the final histological size. Secondary outcomes included change of initial surgical plan and detection of occult contralateral breast cancer. MRI group had 91 patients with median age of 63. Seventy percent of which presented through the screening program. The overall sensitivity of MRI to detect HG DCIS was 77% (70/91) with a false negative rate FNR of 23% (21/91). Therefore, 70 patients only were included in the data analysis. The control group included 52 screening patients with comparable baseline characteristics. Re-excision (or completion mastectomy) rates were higher in the control group 26% compared to 8% in the MRI group (P-value 0.012). MRI use correctly converted the initial plan of breast conservation to mastectomy in 9 patients (13%). Five patients had additional ipsilateral malignant features (7%).Occult contra lateral disease, was diagnosed in 2 patients (3%). This study suggests that MRI could be an important tool in reducing the re-excision rates in the surgical management of HG DCIS. Although still controversial, selective MRI imaging can be useful in the preoperative diagnosis and evaluation of HG DCIS. Case by case discussion at MDT is crucial. Wider adaptation of MRI when indicated in the assessment of breast lesions with proper correlation to histology postoperatively is a key in improving our MRI interpretation skills, helping us to exploit the full scope of this useful tool.",breast_neoplasms
28987661,"Contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) is an advanced breast imaging technique using iodinated intravenous contrast to detect breast cancer. This article describes imaging features of a skin contamination artifact on CEDM that mimics in-situ carcinoma in a case series. Five patients were identified whose CEDM images demonstrated apparent calcifications and non-mass enhancement suspicious for in-situ carcinoma, with no subsequent evidence of disease. Retrospective image analysis was performed on the unprocessed image data, processed images, and imaging parameters. Dual-energy mammographic technique was performed on two breast phantoms with varying degrees of topical contrast contamination. Temporal analysis confirmed the suspicious finding was neither an abnormality of the compression paddle nor the receptor. Comparison of LE and HE images demonstrated the suspicious finding attenuated near the K-edge of iodine, suggesting contrast contamination. Iodinated contrast applied to the surface of breast phantoms replicated the artifact, with a pattern of apparent enhancement similar to the appearance of in-situ carcinoma. Skin contamination with iodinated contrast can result in an artifact on post-contrast digital mammography that mimics the appearance of in-situ carcinoma.",breast_neoplasms
28985927,"Current treatment for HER-2+ breast cancer includes chemotherapy and targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. Evidence is lacking on the safety of breast reconstructive operations in these patients. We hypothesized that targeted HER-2 therapy was not associated with post-mastectomy reconstructive outcomes. Women receiving chemotherapy and post-mastectomy reconstruction at Duke University Medical Center from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively identified. Patients receiving targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab within 6 weeks before breast reconstruction were propensity score-matched 1:1 to patients who did not receive targeted HER-2 therapy, based on the following factors: age, obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, and radiation therapy. Primary study outcomes included the occurrence of hematoma, seroma, infection, wound breakdown, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, and postoperative flap thrombosis. A total of 481 women were identified, resulting in 107 propensity score-matched pairs. Administration of combined trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy before breast reconstruction was independently associated with increased risk of postoperative wound breakdown requiring operative intervention for closure, compared with patients not undergoing targeted HER-2 therapy (odds ratio 65.29; 95% CI 1.63 to 2,611.50; p?= 0.03). In addition, larger tumor size (2 to 5 cm) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative wound breakdown, compared with smaller tumors (<2 cm) (odds ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p?= 0.02). Single-agent targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab was not significantly associated with reconstructive complications. Our study suggests that trastuzumab therapy in conjunction with breast reconstructive operation is not associated with reconstructive complications, and breast reconstruction does not need to be delayed due to the administration of trastuzumab. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of pertuzumab on surgical outcomes.",breast_neoplasms
28985233,"To determine the frequency of breast cancer (BC) patients with hereditary risk features in a wide retrospective cohort of patients in Spain. a retrospective analysis was conducted from 10,638 BC patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2001 in the GEICAM registry ""El ?lamo III"", dividing them into four groups according to modified ESMO and SEOM hereditary cancer risk criteria: Sporadic breast cancer group (R0); Individual risk group (IR); Familial risk group (FR); Individual and familial risk group (IFR) with both individual and familial risk criteria. 7,641 patients were evaluable. Of them, 2,252 patients (29.5%) had at least one hereditary risk criteria, being subclassified in: FR 1.105 (14.5%), IR 970 (12.7%), IFR 177 (2.3%).

28984651,"HER2-positive breast cancers have benefited since the end of the twentieth century, not only from the improvement of biological knowledge, but also from major technological advances. The latter allowed the synthesis of the first generation of enzymatic inhibitors of the HER receptor family such as lapatinib, but above all, monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab or pertuzumab having profoundly modified the management of these cancers. However, despite outstanding progresses, there are still patients who are not cured with these first-generation treatments, and they will need new approaches to improve disease control and impact patients' survival. Understanding the mechanisms of escape to these treatments, more than real resistance, has profoundly changed our pharmacological approaches. They have enabled the development of molecules blocking the signaling pathway downstream of receptors such as mTOR, PI3K inhibitors or molecules interacting with the cellular traffic of the receptor in combination with the first-generation treatments. In addition, new second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated increased in-vitro efficacy, but still need to show clinical relevance because of new toxicity profiles. The antibody engineering had also permitted a paradigm evolution of the role of the antibody treatments, particularly with the synthesis of bispecific and trifunctional antibodies, promoting the link between the tumor and the immune system, with the goal to amplify the immune anticancer response. Among the new anti-HER2 agents, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bifunctional antibodies are promising approaches that will help to improve disease control and curability of HER2-positive breast cancers.",breast_neoplasms

We estimated the lifetime economic and disease burden of breast cancer in Mexico if 95% of parous women breastfeed each child exclusively for 6?months and continue breastfeeding for over a year. We used a static microsimulation model with a cost-of-illness approach to simulate a cohort of Mexican women. We estimated breast cancer incidence, premature mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), medical costs, and income losses due to breast cancer and extrapolated the results to 1.116?million Mexican women of age 15 in 2012. Costs were expressed in 2015 US dollars and discounted at a 3% annual rate. We estimated that 2,186 premature deaths (95% CI 2,123-2,248), 9,936 breast cancer cases (95% CI 9,651-10,220), 45,109 DALYs (95% CI 43,000-47,217), and $245?million USD (95% CI 234-256) in medical costs and income losses owing to breast cancer could be saved over a cohort's lifetime. Medical costs account for 80% of the economic burden; income losses and opportunity costs for caregivers account for 15 and 5%, respectively.

28982906,"This 5-year prospective follow-up of women randomized to general anesthesia (GA) with or without a thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) examined the risk of local recurrence, metastasis and mortality after breast cancer surgery. A total of 180 patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomized to one of three study groups: standardized GA only; GA with a single-injection TPVB (s-TPVB) and placebo paravertebral infusion after surgery for 72-h; and GA plus with continuous TPVB (c-TPVB) for 72-h postoperatively. Cox proportional models were used to assess the effect of TPVB on long-term outcomes. Equivalence testing was used to help interpret the results. The incidence [95% confidence interval (CI)] of cancer recurrence, metastatic spread and all-cause mortality was 2.3% (0.7-5.4%), 7.9% (4.6-12.6%) and 6.8% (3.6-11.2%), respectively. Four women had cancer recurrence and had metastatic spread. Compared to the GA-only group, the risk of metastatic spread was not different from that of GA with s-TPVB [hazard ratio (HR)=1.11, 95% CI=0.32-3.83) nor from that with GA plus c-TPVB (HR=0.79, 95% CI=0.21-2.96) (p=0.88). Compared to the GA-only group, the risk of mortality was similarly not different from that of the two other groups (HR=2.57, 95% CI=0.66-9.92; and HR=0.66, 95% CI=0.11-3.97, respectively, p=0.15). Although the original study was underpowered to properly address long-term outcomes, the results of this analysis suggest that TPVB, administered whether as a single-injection or continuous infusion during the perioperative period, had little to no appreciable effect on local recurrence, metastasis or mortality after breast cancer surgery.",breast_neoplasms

We evaluated that chemotherapy with a TPD regimen (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel) against HER2-positive breast cancer, using TILs as indicators. The subjects were 24 patients who had received TPD-chemotherapy. A semi-quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes invading the stroma in needle biopsy specimens prior to treatment as TILs was conducted, after which, sensitivity to chemotherapy and patient prognosis were evaluated. Overall response rate was significantly higher in the high-TILs group than in the low-TILs group. Significant extension of the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival was found in the high-TILs group compared to the low-TILs group. In addition, high TILs numbers significantly contributed to the extension of PFS.

One of the specific markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts is podoplanin (PDPN) - a mucin-type membrane glycoprotein. The aim of this work was to study the localisation and intensity of expression of Twist and PDPN on the mRNA and protein level in cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), and its association with patients' clinico-pathological data. The study included archival material in a form of 80 paraffin IDC blocks and 11 IDC fragments frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunohistochemical expression of Twist and PDPN was evaluated using light microscope and semiquantitative scale for evaluation of nuclear expression or immunoreactive scale (IRS) for evaluation of cytoplasmic expression. Material was isolated from frozen IDC fragments using laser micro-dissection (from cancer and stromal cells, separately) and was used to perform real-time PCR. Twist expression was higher in stromal cells in comparison to cancer cells. Analysis of patients' survival rate showed, that higher expression of Twist in cancer cells was associated with shorter overall survival time and shorter event-free survival time. The expression of PDPN was also higher in stromal cells in comparison with cancer cells. In addition, positive correlation was observed between expression of Twist and PDPN in stromal cells of IDC (r=0.267; p<0.05). The relationship between the higher expression of Twist in both cancer and stromal cells and shorter patients' survival indicates Twist as a potential useful prognostic marker in IDC.

28982110,"Liver metastases present with distinct histopathological growth patterns (HGPs), including the desmoplastic, pushing and replacement HGPs and two rarer HGPs. The HGPs are defined owing to the distinct interface between the cancer cells and the adjacent normal liver parenchyma that is present in each pattern and can be scored from standard haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. The current study provides consensus guidelines for scoring these HGPs. Guidelines for defining the HGPs were established by a large international team. To assess the validity of these guidelines, 12 independent observers scored a set of 159 liver metastases and interobserver variability was measured. In an independent cohort of 374 patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM), the impact of HGPs on overall survival after hepatectomy was determined. Good-to-excellent correlations (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.5) with the gold standard were obtained for the assessment of the replacement HGP and desmoplastic HGP. Overall survival was significantly superior in the desmoplastic HGP subgroup compared with the replacement or pushing HGP subgroup (P=0.006).

An automatic method was developed to segment the NAC and the tumor and to compute the 3D distance between them. The automatic measurement was compared with manual axial and sagittal 2D measurements. NAC involvement was defined by the presence of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ or ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN1c - DIN3). Tumor-NAC distance was computed on 95/99 patients (25 NAC+), as three tumors were not correctly segmented (sensitivity?=?97%), and 1 NAC was not detected (sensitivity?=?99%).

28973706,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The management of breast cancer depends on clinical and pathologic prognostic factors that help guide patient treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive form of breast cancer with an unpredictable risk of either progression to invasive disease or recurrence. To evaluate the utilization of the DCIS score in a large single-institution population and understand reasons for avoidance in eligible patients. A retrospective chart review of eligible patients with pure DCIS treated by lumpectomy (January 2011-May 2015) was performed. Patients were considered eligible for the assay if they met the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E5194 pathology criteria. All of the patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and were estrogen receptor positive. Of 182 estrogen receptor-positive patients with DCIS who underwent breast-conserving surgery, 31 (17%) had a DCIS assay performed; however, most of the patients did not have a DCIS score assay performed, yet 47.9% of this cohort would have met the pathologic eligibility criteria. Conversely, 82.5% of the patients having the DCIS score evaluated actually met these criteria. Tumor size, grade, ER status, and calcifications were drivers of patient selection for 12-gene assay use. E5194 eligibility criteria selected for low risk population. Although a large proportion of patients met eligibility criteria, DCIS Score was infrequently considered for recurrence risk estimation. When performed, assay scores supported omission of radiation for over 75% of cases.",breast_neoplasms

In this study, we investigate the frequency of hematological malignancies, their relative primary and secondary occurrences, and further characterize the distinct histopathologies of these malignancies with a special focus on lymphomas. To our knowledge this is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of breast hematologic malignancies. We conducted a retrospective review of our institution's pathology database for hematologic neoplasms diagnosed in breast tissue during a period of 22 years (1992-2014). Clinical characteristics, patient history, histologic subtype, and patient outcomes were analyzed. We identified 52 cases; 46 lymphomas, 4 plasmacytomas, and 2 myeloid sarcomas. The lymphoma cases were 15 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), 14 follicular lymphomas (FLs), 8 marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), 2 anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas, 2 peripheral T-cell lymphomas-not otherwise specified, 1 each of small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. In total, 30 cases were primary and 22 cases were secondary to the breast. Primary lymphomas accounted for 60% of lymphomas. Most FLs and almost all MZLs were primary. Primary hematological malignancies of the breast are more common than secondary: 58 % versus 42%. This finding is more evident in lymphomas: 63% versus 37%. The most common hematological malignancy in our study was DLBCL, followed by FL and MZL. Most FLs and almost all MZLs were primary. At the same time, the percentage of primary DLBCLs in our study is lower than the percentage reported in previous studies. We suggest that this could be the result of transformation from low-grade lymphomas. Although rare, hematological malignancies of the breast warrant a higher level of clinical suspicion as they present similarly to breast carcinomas but require a substantially different therapeutic approach.",breast_neoplasms

28969622,"Increasingly, women elect breast reconstruction after mastectomy. However, their expectations of surgery are often not met, and dissatisfaction with outcome and ongoing psychosocial concerns and distress are common. We developed a patient-centered intervention, PEGASUS:(Patients' Expectations and Goals: Assisting Shared Understanding of Surgery) which supports shared decision making by helping women clarify their own, individual goals about reconstruction so that they can discuss these with their surgeon. Our acceptability/feasibility work has shown it is well received by patients and health professionals alike. We now need to establish whether PEGASUS improves patients' experiences of breast reconstruction decision making and outcomes. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to examine the effectiveness of PEGASUS, an intervention designed to support shared decision making about breast reconstruction. A multi-centered sequential study will compare the impact of PEGASUS with usual care, in terms of patient reported outcomes (self-reported satisfaction with the outcome of surgery, involvement in decision making and in the consultation) and health economics. Initially we will collect data from our comparison (usual care) group (90 women) who will complete standardized measures (Breast-Q, EQ5D -5?L and ICECAP- A) at the time of decision making, 3, 6 and 12?months after surgery. Health professionals will then be trained to use PEGASUS, which will be delivered to the intervention group (another 90 women completing the same measures at the time of decision making, and 3, 6 and 12?months after surgery). Health professionals and a purposefully selected sample of participants will be interviewed about whether their expectations of reconstruction were met, and their experiences of PEGASUS (if appropriate).

The aim of this review was to investigate the relation between a posteriori-derived dietary patterns, grouped as healthy or unhealthy, and cancer risk. The relation between cancer risk and background characteristics associated with adherence to dietary patterns was also examined. PubMed and Embase electronic databases were searched. A total of 93 studies including over 85?000 cases, 100?000 controls, and 2?000?000 exposed individuals were selected. Data were extracted from each identified study using a standardized form by two independent authors. The most convincing evidence (significant results from prospective cohort studies) supported an association between healthy dietary patterns and decreased risk of colon and breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal, hormone receptor-negative women, and an association between unhealthy dietary patterns and increased risk of colon cancer. Limited evidence of a relation between an unhealthy dietary pattern and risk of upper aerodigestive tract, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial, and prostatic cancers relied only on case-control studies. Unhealthy dietary patterns were associated with higher body mass index and energy intake, while healthy patterns were associated with higher education, physical activity, and less smoking.

It is driven by chromosomal translocation t(15;19) involving the rearrangement of NUT (nuclear protein in testis) and BRD4 (bromodomain 4) genes leading to fusion oncoprotein BRD4-NUT. We report the case of a woman who was previously treated with induction chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and adjuvant trastuzumab for HER-2 positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. After 6 months of follow-up a lung nodule appeared. A biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma fetal type/lung blastoma, so a left inferior lobectomy was performed: NMC harboring BRD4-NUT rearrangement was diagnosed. After 9 months of follow-up, bone and soft tissue metastases occurred, so the patient was given radiotherapy. Next-generation sequencing technology identified somatic mutations in deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), mixed lineage leukemia protein 3 (MLL3), and splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) genes in NMC cells from both primitive cancer and metastases. The patient was treated with the experimental BRD4 inhibitor for 10 months, until the disease progressed to the lung and bone. After spinal cord compression, the patient was offered palliative radiotherapy to bone and eventually died aged 39 years. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first DCC, MLL3, and SF3B1 mutated NUT midline carcinoma reported in the literature.

28964442,"To identify the incremental costs and consequences of stratified national breast screening programs (stratified NBSPs) and drivers of relative cost-effectiveness. A decision-analytic model (discrete event simulation) was conceptualized to represent four stratified NBSPs (risk 1, risk 2, masking [supplemental screening for women with higher breast density], and masking and risk 1) compared with the current UK NBSP and no screening. The model assumed a lifetime horizon, the health service perspective to identify costs (?, 2015), and measured consequences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multiple data sources were used: systematic reviews of effectiveness and utility, published studies reporting costs, and cohort studies embedded in existing NBSPs. Model parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis. The base-case analysis, supported by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, suggested that the risk stratified NBSPs (risk 1 and risk-2) were relatively cost-effective when compared with the current UK NBSP, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ?16,689 per QALY and ?23,924 per QALY, respectively. Stratified NBSP including masking approaches (supplemental screening for women with higher breast density) was not a cost-effective alternative, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ?212,947 per QALY (masking) and ?75,254 per QALY (risk 1 and masking). When compared with no screening, all stratified NBSPs could be considered cost-effective. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were discount rate, natural history model parameters, mammographic sensitivity, and biopsy rates for recalled cases. A key assumption was that the risk model used in the stratification process was perfectly calibrated to the population. This early model-based cost-effectiveness analysis provides indicative evidence for decision makers to understand the key drivers of costs and QALYs for exemplar stratified NBSP.",breast_neoplasms

Statistical analysis was performed using the SNPStats and SPSS software. Linkage disequilibrium and gene-gene interactions were performed using Haploview and MDR software respectively. Further, transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of SNPs under study were carried out using AliBaba2.1 software. We have observed an increased frequency of 2G-allele of MMP1, 6A-allele of MMP3 and T-allele of MMP9 (p<0.05) respectively in BC subjects. The 2G-6A haplotype (minor alleles of MMP-1 and MMP-3 respectively) has shown an increased susceptibility to BC. Further, MMP polymorphisms were associated with the clinical characteristics of BC patients such as steroid hormone receptor status, lymph node involvement and metastasis. SNP combinations were in perfect LD in controls. MDR analysis revealed a positive interaction between the SNPs. 5-years survival rate and cox-regression analysis showed a significant association with clinicopathological variables. Our results suggest that MMP1-1607 1G/2G, MMP3-1171 5A/6A and MMP9-1562 C/T gene polymorphisms have synergistic effect on breast cancer. The interactions of MMPs clinical risk factors such as lymph node involvement has shown a strong correlation and might influence the 5-years survival rate, suggesting their potential role in the breast carcinogenesis.",breast_neoplasms

28954297,"The long-term effects of chemotherapy are sparsely reported. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most frequent toxicities associated with taxane use for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. We investigated the impact of the three different docetaxel-based regimens and patient characteristics on long-term, patient-reported outcomes of PN and the impact of PN on long-term quality of life (QOL). The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-30 was a randomized trial comparing sequential doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) followed by docetaxel (T) (AC¡æT), concurrent ACT, or AT in women with node-positive, early-stage breast cancer. The AC¡æT group had a higher cumulative dose of T. PN was one of the symptoms assessed in a QOL substudy. Statistical methods included simple and mixed ordinal logistic regression and general linear models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Of 1512 patients, 41.9% reported PN two years after treatment initiation. Treatment with AT and ACT was associated with less severe long-term PN compared with AC¡æT (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.58; OR?=?0.59, 95% CI?=?0.46 to 0.75).

Whether insurance type also affects subsequent revisions remains unknown. This study explores the relationship among payor type, revision procedures, and the completion of breast reconstruction. A retrospective cohort study was created including patients who underwent breast reconstruction at the authors' institution from 1996 to 2016. Data collected included age, cancer stage, race, laterality, initial breast reconstruction type, total number of procedures, number of trips to the operating room, and subsequent revisions. Analysis of covariance and logistic regression were used to estimate the controlled mean number of revisions and probability of completion of reconstruction as a function of insurance type. A total of 3113 patients were included: 2271 (72.9 percent) with private insurance, 450 (14.5 percent) with Medicare, and 392 (12.6 percent) with Medicaid. On controlled analysis, there was no difference in total number of procedures, number of revisions, or number of trips to the operating room among the three insurance types. There was no difference in the proportion of patients undergoing symmetry procedures or nipple-areola reconstruction. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate discrepancies in number of procedures, revisions, and the proportion of patients completing breast reconstruction among insurance types. When controlling for other factors, the authors report no differences in care based solely on payor type. Instead, patient and surgeon variables may be responsible for the differences observed, and should be targeted in future research to improve equity. Therapeutic, III.",breast_neoplasms

Rural survivors of breast cancer have reported poorer outcomes, poorer mental health and physical functioning, and lower-than-average quality of life compared to urban survivors. To explore the feasibility and acceptability of developing a mobile health survivorship care app to facilitate care coordination; support medical, psychosocial, and practical needs; and improve survivors' long-term health outcomes. An interactive prototype app, SmartSurvivor, was developed that included recommended survivorship care plan components. The prototype's feasibility and acceptability were tested by a sample of breast cancer survivors (n=6), primary care providers (n=4), and an oncologist (n=1). Overall, both survivors and providers felt that SmartSurvivor was a potentially valuable tool to support long-term survivorship care plan objectives. Portability, accessibility, and having one place for all contact, treatment, symptom tracking, and medication summaries was highly valued. Our pilot study indicates that SmartSurvivor is a feasible and acceptable approach to meeting survivorship care objectives and the needs of both breast cancer survivors and their health care providers.

However, little is known about the actions of propolis and CAPE on tumor in inflammatory microenvironment, and inflammatory responses play decisive roles at different stages of tumor development. To understand the effects and mechanisms of ethanol-extracted Chinese propolis (EECP) and its major constituent - CAPE in inflammation-stimulated tumor, we investigated their effects on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway which plays a crucial role in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line. 80% confluent breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with 1 ¼g/mL lipopolysaccaride (LPS). Then the cells were divided for treatment by CAPE (25 ¼g/mL) and EECP (25, 50 and 100 ¼g/mL), respectively. Cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production and cell migration were measured by sulforhodamine B assay, chemical method and scratch assay. The levels of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK4, TRIF, caspase 3, PARP, LC3B and p62 were investigated through western blotting. The expression of TLR4, LC3B and nuclear factor-ºB p65 (NF-ºB p65) were tested by immunofluorescence microscopy assay. Treatment of different concentrations of EECP (25, 50 and 100 ¼g/mL) and CAPE (25 ¼g/mL) significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cell line proliferation, migration and NO production. Furthermore, EECP and CAPE activated caspase3 and PARP to induce cell apoptosis, and also upregulated LC3-II and decreased p62 level to induce autophagy during the process.

Online survey based on a previously validated approach. The aims of the study were to evaluate (i) the availability on national formulary of licensed antineoplastic medicines across the globe, (ii) patient out-of-pocket costs for the medications, (iii) the actual availability of the medication for a patient with a valid prescription, (iv) information relating to possible factors adversely impacting the availability of antineoplastic agents and (v) the impact of the country's level of economic development on these parameters. A total of 304 field reporters from 97 countries were invited to participate. The preliminary set of data was posted on the ESMO website for open peer review and amendments have been incorporated into the final report. Surveys were submitted by 135 reporters from 63 countries and additional peer-review data were submitted by 54 reporters from 19 countries. There are substantial differences in the formulary availability, out-of-pocket costs and actual availability for many anticancer medicines. The most substantial issues are in lower-middle- and low-income countries. Even among medications on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) the discrepancies are profound and these relate to high out-of-pocket costs (in low-middle-income countries 32.0% of EML medicines are available only at full cost and 5.2% are not available at all, and for low-income countries, the corresponding figures are even worse at 57.7% and 8.3%, respectively). There is wide global variation in formulary availability, out-of-pocket expenditures and actual availability for most licensed anticancer medicines. Low- and low-middle-income countries have significant lack of availability and high out-of-pocket expenditures for cancer medicines on the WHO EML, with much less availability of new, more expensive targeted agents compared with high-income countries.",breast_neoplasms

Buparlisib is a pan-class-I PI3K inhibitor with potent and selective activity against wild-type and mutant PI3K p110 isoforms. PIKHER2 phase IB study aimed primarily to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and propose a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for buparlisib in combination with lapatinib in HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced breast cancer. Oral buparlisib (40, 60 or 80?mg) and lapatinib (750, 1000 or 1250?mg) were administered daily. A modified continuous reassessment method using an adaptive Bayesian model guided the dose escalation of both agents. Secondary end-points included antitumour activity and pharmacokinetic?(PK) assessments. A total of 24 patients were treated across five dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities included transaminases elevation, vomiting, stomatitis, hyperglycemia and diarrhoea. MTD was declared at buparlisib 80?mg/d?+?lapatinib 1250?mg/d, but toxicities and early treatment discontinuation rate beyond cycle 1 led to select buparlisib 80?mg?+?lapatinib 1000?mg/d as the RP2D. Main drug-related adverse events included diarrhoea, nausea, skin rash, asthenia, depression, anxiety and transaminases increase. There was no significant evidence for drug-drug PK interaction.

28946846,"Current evidence on risk of prostate cancer following a diagnosis of male breast cancer is limited and guidance for screening in this potentially higher-risk population remainsunclear. Our objective was to quantify prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed with breast cancer. We identified men diagnosed with first primary breast cancer between 1988 and 2012 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program registry databases. Men were followed for occurrence of a second primary prostate cancer and secondary outcomes of cancer-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were performed by age, breast cancer stage, race, and breast cancer hormone receptor status. Excess risk per 10,000 person-years and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. We used multivaraible Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for characteristics associated with secondary prostate cancer and survival. From a cohort of 5753 men with breast cancer with median follow up of 4.3?years, we identified 250 cases of second primary prostate cancer. Overall, the incidence of second primary prostate cancer was modestly greater than expected (SIR?=?1.12, 95% CI 0.93-1.33), although not statistically significant. Stratified analyses demonstrated associations for men ages 65-74 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (SIR?=?1.34, 95%CI 1.01-1.73), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (SIR?=?1.23, 95%CI 1.11-1.39) or AJCC stage I breast cancer (SIR?=?1.36, 95%CI 1.04-1.75) and second primary prostate cancer diagnosis. The incidence of prostate cancer in men with history of breast cancer is similar to the general population. Men with favorable characteristics of their breast cancer were more likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly due to a lower competing risk of breast cancer mortality.",breast_neoplasms
28945887,"Genomic changes that occur in breast cancer during the course of disease have been informed by sequencing of primary and metastatic tumor tissue. For patients with relapsed and metastatic disease, evolution of the breast cancer genome highlights the importance of using a recent sample for genomic profiling to guide clinical decision-making. Obtaining a metastatic tissue biopsy can be challenging, and analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from blood may provide a minimally invasive alternative. Hybrid capture-based genomic profiling was carried out on ctDNA from 254 female patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Peripheral blood samples were submitted by clinicians in the course of routine clinical care between May 2016 and March 2017. Sequencing of 62 genes was carried out to a median unique coverage depth of 7503×. Genomic alterations (GAs) in ctDNA were evaluated and compared with matched tissue samples and genomic datasets of tissue from breast cancer. At least 1 GA was reported in 78% of samples. Frequently altered genes were TP53 (38%), ESR1 (31%) and PIK3CA (31%). Temporally matched ctDNA and tissue samples were available for 14 patients; 89% of mutations detected in tissue were also detected in ctDNA. Diverse ESR1 GAs including mutation, rearrangement and amplification, were observed. Multiple concurrent ESR1 GAs were observed in 40% of ESR1-altered cases, suggesting polyclonal origin; ESR1 compound mutations were also observed in two cases. ESR1-altered cases harbored co-occurring GAs in PIK3CA (35%), FGFR1 (16%), ERBB2 (8%), BRCA1/2 (5%), and AKT1 (4%). GAs relevant to relapsed/metastatic breast cancer management were identified, including diverse ESR1 GAs. Genomic profiling of ctDNA demonstrated sensitive detection of mutations found in tissue.

Patients and tumour characteristics were retrospectively collected and analysed for association with genomic rearrangements (mutations, amplification, deletions). Only gene alterations observed in?>3% of the tumours were selected. A total of 193 genomic rearrangements were identified, and 16 were observed in?>3% of tumours. One was statistically correlated to the risk of local relapse. A median loco-regional progression-free survival (LRPFS) of 23.6?years was reported for PIK3CA mutation carriers (n?=?31, 21.2%) versus 9.9?years for PIK3CA wild-type patients (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.65, P?=?0.002 in univariate analysis).

The G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) was identified as the receptor of CXCL17 and named recently as CXCR8. The function of the CXCL17-CXCR8 (GPR35) biological axis in cancer has not been reported. The expression of CXCL17 and CXCR8 (GPR35) in breast cancer cell lines and a tissue microarray (TMA) was detected through western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression data in IHC were analyzed using clinicopatholigical and survival information. CXCL17 and CXCR8 (GPR35) were found to be variably expressed in breast cancer cell lines. Both expressed higher in breast cancer tissue than normal adjacent tissue. Although CXCL17 can interact with CXCR8 (GPR35) in breast cancer cells in?vitro, the expression correlation between these two markers in breast cancer tissue was not found to be significant. As to clinical significance, CXCR8 (GPR35) expression was found to be significantly associated with advanced histological grade and higher proliferation rate indicated by Ki-67 expression. Although CXCL17 was not found to statistically correlate with any clinicopathological characteristics, it was found to be associated with shorter overall survival and is an independent marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer. In addition, CXCL17 was found to promote proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in?vitro and in?vivo. We investigated the role of the CXCL17-CXCR8 (GPR35) axis in breast cancer for the first time.

We generated a constitutively knocked-down PRODH/POX MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (MCF-7shPRODH/POX) as a model to analyze the functional consequences of impaired intracellular proline levels. We have used inhibitor of proline utilization in collagen biosynthesis, 2-metoxyestradiol (MOE), inhibitor of prolidase that generate proline, rapamycin (Rap) and glycyl-proline (GlyPro), substrate for prolidase. Collagen and DNA biosynthesis were evaluated by radiometric assays. Cell viability was determined using Nucleo-Counter NC-3000. The activity of prolidase was determined by colorimetric assay. Expression of proteins was assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence bioimaging. Concentration of proline was analyzed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. PRODH/POX knockdown decreased DNA and collagen biosynthesis, whereas increased prolidase activity and intracellular proline level in MCF-7shPRODH/POX cells. All studied compounds decreased cell viability in MCF-7 and MCF-7shPRODH/POX cells. DNA biosynthesis was similarly inhibited by Rap and MOE in both cell lines, but GlyPro inhibited the process only in MCF-7shPRODH/POX and MOE+GlyPro only in MCF-7 cells. All the compounds inhibited collagen biosynthesis, increased prolidase activity and cytoplasmic proline level in MCF-7shPRODH/POX cells and contributed to the induction of pro-survival mode only in MCF-7shPRODH/POX cells. In contrast, all studied compounds upregulated expression of pro-apoptotic protein only in MCF-7 cells. PRODH/POX was confirmed as a driver of apoptosis and proved the eligibility of MCF-7shPRODH/POX cell line as a highly effective model to elucidate the different mechanisms underlying proline utilization or generation in PRODH/POX-dependent pro-apoptotic pathways.",breast_neoplasms

Mammograms of women diagnosed with an interval cancer were included in the study if they had been allocated to either the ""suspicious signs"" group or ""subtle signs"" group, during the historic interval cancer review. Three radiologists, individually and blinded to the site of interval cancer, reviewed the mammograms and documented the presence, site, characteristics and classification of any abnormality. Findings were compared with the appearances of the abnormality at the site of subsequent cancer development by a different breast radiologist. The chi-squared test was used in the analysis of the results, seeking associations between recall concordance and cancer mammographic or histological characteristics. 111/590 interval cancers fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. In 17% of the cases none of the readers identified the relevant abnormality on the screening mammogram. 1/3 readers identified the relevant lesion in 22% of the cases, 2/3 readers in 28% of cases and all 3 readers in 33% of cases. The commonest unanimously recalled abnormality was microcalcification and the most challenging mammographic abnormality to detect was asymmetric density.

Histogram-based (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and variance), and co-occurrence matrix-based (contrast, correlation, energy, entropy, and homogeneity) 2D, weighted average of the 2D slices, and true 3D TA were obtained on the CET1 images and LBP maps. For LBP maps and 2D TA contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity were identified as statistically different heterogeneity parameters (SDHPs) between lung and breast metastasis. The weighted 3D TA identified entropy as an additional SDHP. Only two texture indexes (TI) were significantly different with true 3D TA: entropy and energy. All these TIs discriminated between the two tumor types significantly by ROC analysis. For the CET1 images there was no SDHP at all by 3D TA.

An Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Spine Center surgical database was queried (years 2002-2010) to identify patients with an ICD-9 code indicative of metastatic spine disease. Patients whose only surgical treatment was vertebral augmentation were not included. Scatter plots of survival versus the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi metastatic spine scoring systems were statistically analyzed. Spine-related morbidity and mortality rates were calculated. Sixty-eight patients were identified: 45 patients' (30 male patients, mean age 45 y) medical records included operative, morbidity, and mortality statistic data and 38 (26 male patients, mean age 54 y) contained complete metastatic spine scoring system data. Of the 38 deceased spine metastatic patients, 8 had renal cell, 7 lung, 4 breast, 2 chondrosarcoma, 2 prostate, 11 other, and 4 unknown primary cancers. Linear regression analysis revealed R values of 0.2570 and 0.2009 for the revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems, respectively. Overall transfusion, infection, morbidity, and mortality rates were 33% and 9%, and 42% and 9%, respectively. Application of metastatic prognostic scoring systems to a retrospective surgical cohort revealed an overall poor correlation with the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi predictive survival models. Morbidity and mortality rates concur with those in the medical literature. This study underscores the difficulty in utilizing metastatic spine scoring systems to predict patient survival. We believe a scoring system based on cancer type is needed to account for changes in treatment paradigms with improved patient survival over time.",breast_neoplasms

The VW female phantom was used in the simulations. Planning target volume (PTV) was defined in the left breast. The 6MV parallel-opposed fields breast-radiotherapy (RT) protocol was simulated with MCNPx code. The absorbed doses were evaluated in all the organs. The secondary cancer-incidence risk induced by radiotherapy was calculated for different age groups according to the BEIR VII methodology. RT quality indexes indicated that the protocol was properly simulated. Significant absorbed dose values in red bone marrow, RBM (0.8 Gy) and stomach (0.6 Gy) were observed. The contralateral breast presented the highest risk of incidence of a secondary cancer followed by leukaemia, lung and stomach. The risk of a secondary cancer-incidence by breast-RT, for the Brazilian population, ranged between 2.2-1.7% and 0.6-0.4%. RBM and stomach, usually not considered as OAR, presented high second cancer incidence risks of 0.5-0.3% and 0.4-0.1%, respectively. This study may be helpful for breast-RT risk/benefit assessment.

28935151,"Dietary agents play an important role in cancer prevention and therapy because of their low toxicity and the perception that they are not a medicine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of the administration of garlic and lemon aqueous extracts against breast cancer implanted in mice. We used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay to determine the antiproliferative effect of both extracts and their combinations. Isobolographic method was used to calculate the combination index. Balb/C mice were inoculated with EMT6/P breast cancer cells and received intragastric administration of one of three treatments (garlic alone, lemon alone, or a combination of both). Change in tumor size and survival rates were measured. TUNEL assay was used to measure apoptosis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Serum levels of interferon-¥ã, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were measured using ELISA and levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and creatinine were determined. The combination of both extracts acts synergistically against breast cancer in mice. Of the treated mice, 80% were cured using this combination. This combination inhibited angiogenesis, induced apoptosis, and caused systemic activation in the immune system. The combination of garlic and lemon aqueous extracts represents a promising option to develop an anticancer food for augmenting conventional anticancer therapies. However, further testing is essential to understand the exact molecular mechanisms of this combination and ",breast_neoplasms

Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies. Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion-sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis-confront the estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally. Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with menopausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy. The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade, vaginal testosterone, and estetrol. Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer.

The impact of postmenopausal breast cancer on CVD for older women is uncertain. We hypothesized that older postmenopausal women with breast cancer would be at a higher risk of CVD than similar aged women without breast cancer and that CVD would be a major contributor to the subsequent morbidity and mortality. In a prospective Women's Health Initiative study, incident CVD events and total and cause-specific death rates were compared between postmenopausal women with (n = 4,340) and without (n = 97,576) incident invasive breast cancer over 10 years post-diagnosis, stratified by 3 age groups (50-59, 60-69, and 70-79). Postmenopausal women, regardless of breast cancer diagnosis, had similar and high levels of CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking and hypertension) at baseline prior to breast cancer, which were strong predictors of CVD and total mortality over time. CVD affected mostly women age 70-79 with localized breast cancer (79% of breast cancer cases in 70-79 age group): only 17% died from breast cancer and CVD was the leading cause of death (22%) over the average 10 years follow up. Compared to age-matched women without breast cancer, women age 70-79 at diagnosis of localized breast cancer had a similar multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-1.33) for coronary heart disease, a lower risk of composite CVD (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70-1.00), and a higher risk of total mortality (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.39). CVD was a major contributor to mortality in women with localized breast cancer at age 70-79. Further studies are needed to evaluate both screening and treatment of localized breast cancer tailored to the specific health issues of older women.",breast_neoplasms
28932949,"Grenada is a small island nation of 105,000 in the Caribbean with one single general hospital and pathology laboratory. This study assesses cancer incidence on the island based on existing pathology reports, and compares the cancer mortality burden between Grenada and other Caribbean nations. Age-adjusted overall and site-specific cancer ""incidence"" rates (based on pathology reports) and mortality rates were calculated and compared for 2000-2009. Next, mortality rates for a more recent period, 2007-2013, were calculated for Grenada and a pool of English-speaking, majority African-ancestry Caribbean island nations. Lastly, for direct mortality comparisons by cancer site, mortality rate ratios were computed using negative binomial regression modeling. The pathology reports alone do not suffice to calculate national incidence rates but cancer mortality rates are rapidly increasing in Grenada. The leading causes of cancer mortality were prostate and lung cancers among men, and breast and cervical cancers among women. Overall cancer mortality is significantly higher for both male and female Grenadians than their Caribbean counterparts: RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.32-1.55) and RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.15-1.38), respectively. High prostate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma rates are concerning. Given the small existing cancer infrastructure, excessive mortality in Grenada compared to its neighbors may be disproportionately more attributable to low survival than a high cancer risk. Global solutions will be required to meet the cancer control needs of geographically isolated small nations such as Grenada.",breast_neoplasms

English articles were retrieved through searching Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase databases updated to February 2017. Studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The curative effects of radiotherapy-based therapies forHER2+ BC patients were assessed using hazard rates (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs), as well as their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, Egger test was used to assess publication bias, followed by sensitivity analysis. All statistic methods were conducted using R 3.12 software. A total of 9 eligible studies were included into this meta-analysis, which involved 2236 HER2+ BC patients. Egger test showed that the eligible studies had no publication bias (t?=?2.198, P?=?.05918). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were stable. HER2+ BC patients in radiotherapy group had lower locoregional recurrences than those in other groups. Moreover, meta-analysis showed that no significant difference was found between HER2+ BC patients in radiotherapy group and other groups on the 1-year overall survival (P?=?0.5263, I?=?65.4%), 3-year overall survival (P?=?0.4591, I?=?0), and 5-year overall survival (P?=?0.06277, I?=?0).

However, the prognostic relevance of CCR7 expression in breast cancer remains contradictory till now. The aim of this study is to assess the correlation of the CCR7 expression with other clinicopathological features and prognosis in breast cancer. The CCR7 gene amplification and mRNA expression levels from approximately 3,000 patients were retrieved from human breast cancer databases and analyzed. Furthermore, a total of 188 primary triple negative breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study (diagnosed since January 2009 to January 2013 from the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The protein levels of CCR7 were examined by immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. The analysis of gene amplification and mRNA levels showed the expression of CCR7 in breast cancer correlated with better prognosis. When we compared the CCR7 expressions in different subtypes, the basal-like group showed the highest expression of CCR7 and exhibited a better prognosis. Consistently, Kaplan-Meier analysis of 188 triple negative breast cancer patients showed that the prognosis of patients with positive CCR7 expression was significantly better than those with negative expression (HR=0.642, p=0.0275). Additionally, we also observed a positive correlation between lymph node metastasis and the CCR7 expression (p=0.0096). Our results indicated that elevated CCR7 expression as a marker for increased lymph node metastasis, in addition to serve as an independent prognostic indicator for better overall survival in triple negative breast cancer patients.",breast_neoplasms

Using data from the 2002, 2007, and 2012 National Health Interview Survey, the study included 1359 persons with a cancer diagnosis of selected cancers in the past 5 years. Participants were asked about their use of complementary health approaches for general reasons and cancer treatment in the past 12 months. Responses were aggregated into the use of any complementary approach as well as examined by mode of practice. Overall, 35.3% of persons with a cancer diagnosis used complementary health approaches in the past 12 months. These persons were more likely to have used a biologically based approach (22.8%) compared with other approaches. Persons with breast cancer were significantly more likely to use any complementary health approach (43.6%) compared with those with other recently diagnosed cancers. Few persons with a cancer history (2.3%) used complementary approaches specifically for cancer treatment. However, prevalence of use for treatment varied by cancer type (0.4%-6.8%).

28929806,"The objective of our study was to determine outcomes of lesions identified as clustered microcysts on breast ultrasound to augment the existing literature and help guide appropriate management recommendations. We retrospectively identified cases at our institution, from January 2003 through December 2013, of all lesions classified as clustered microcysts at breast ultrasound. Breast ultrasound examinations were performed by the interpreting physician. If ultrasound-guided sampling was performed, results were obtained from the pathology or cytology reports. If sampling was not performed, only lesions with at least 24 months of imaging follow-up or any imaging follow-up with interval resolution or decrease in size were included in the study. Outcomes and frequency of malignancy were determined by reviewing the electronic medical records and our PACS. Of 144 patients with 148 lesions classified as clustered microcysts on ultrasound, 93 patients with 95 lesions had adequate follow-up and were included in our study population. The mean patient age was 50 years (range, 32-72 years). Of the 16 lesions that underwent percutaneous sampling, none (0% [95% CI, 0-21%]) yielded malignancy. Fourteen (88%) sampled lesions were benign, and two (12%) of the sampled lesions revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia at percutaneous sampling but no atypia or upgrade at subsequent surgical excision. In total, 0 of 95 lesions (0% [95% CI, 0-3.8%]) showed malignancy at sampling or imaging follow-up. Our results support that lesions sonographically characterized as clustered microcysts carry an extremely low risk of malignancy, and biopsy should be avoided.",breast_neoplasms
28927756,"Limited data exist regarding the range of heart doses received in routine practice with radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer in the United States today and the potential effect of the continual assessment of the cardiac dose on practice patterns. From 2012 to 2015, 4688 patients with breast cancer treated with whole breast RT at 20 sites participating in a state-wide consortium were enrolled into a registry. The importance of limiting the cardiac dose has been emphasized in the consortium since 2012, and the mean heart dose (MHD) has been reported by each institution since 2014. The effects on the MHD were estimated for both conventional and accelerated fractionation using regression models, with technique (intensity modulated RT [IMRT] vs 3-dimensional conformal RT), deep inspiration breath hold use, patient position (supine vs prone), nodal RT (if delivered), and boost (yes vs no) as covariates. For left-sided breast cancer treated with conventional fractionation, the median MHD in 2012 was 2.19?Gy versus 1.65?Gy in 2015 (P<.001). The factors that significantly increased the MHD for conventional fractionation were increased separation relative to 22?cm (1.5%/1?cm), supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodal RT (17.1%), internal mammary nodal RT (40.7%), use of a boost (20.9%), treatment year before 2015 (7.7%), and use of IMRT (20.8%). For left-sided BC treated with accelerated fractionation, the median MHD in 2012 was 1.70?Gy versus 1.22?Gy in 2015 (P<.001). The factors that significantly increased the MHD for accelerated fractionation were separation (1.7%/1?cm), use of a boost (20.0%), year before 2015 (8.5%), and use of IMRT (19.2%). The factors for both conventional fractionation and accelerated fractionation that significantly reduced the MHD were the use of deep inspiration breath hold and prone positioning. The MHD for left-sided breast cancer decreased during a recent 4-year period, coincident with an increased focus on cardiac sparing in the radiation oncology community in general and a state-wide consortium specifically.

A total of 123 patients chose to participate in one of the interventions. A control group was set up for those who agreed not to participate. Emotional distress, fatigue, and sleep quality were assessed before (T0) and after interventions (T1), and at 3-month (T2) and 9-month follow-ups (T3). Nine months after interventions, there was a decrease of anxiety (P=0.000), depression (P=0.000), and fatigue (P=0.002) in the hypnosis group, and a decrease of anxiety (P=0.024) in the yoga group. There were no significant improvements for all the investigated variables in the CBT and control groups.

The available HEE literature was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively, using available instruments. HEEs published between 1/1/2000 and 31/10/2016 were retrieved through a systematic search in Medline, Cochrane and Embase. A quality-assessment using CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) was translated into a quantitative score and compared with Tufts Medical Centre CEA registry and Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) results. Twenty cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and thirteen cost comparisons (CC) were analysed. In qualitative evaluation, valuation or justification of data sources, population heterogeneity and discussion on generalizability, in addition to declaration on funding, were often absent or incomplete. After quantification, the average CHEERS-scores were 74% (CI 66.9-81.1%) and 75.6% (CI 70.7-80.5%) for CEAs and CCs respectively. CEA-scores did not differ significantly from Tufts and QHES-scores.

In the randomized phase III IDEAL trial, postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly allocated to either 2.5 or five years of letrozole after the initial five years of any endocrine therapy. The primary end point was disease free survival (DFS), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free interval (DMFi), new primary breast cancer, and safety. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox regression analysis. All analyses were by intention-to-treat principle. A total of 1824 patients were assigned to either 2.5?years (n?=?909) or five years (n?=?915) of letrozole, with a median follow-up of 6.6?years.

The Tob/BTG antiproliferative (APRO) protein family is reported to participate in diverse human diseases. However, there's little known about their expression and prognostic values in most human cancers. We performed a detailed cancer vs. normal analysis. The mRNA expression levels of APRO family in various cancers were analyzed via the Oncomine database. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and PrognScan databases were used to evaluate the prognostic values. We observed that the mRNA expression levels of TOB1-2 and BTG2 were decreased in most cancers compared with normal tissues, while BTG3 was upregulated in most cancers. In survival analyses based on Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TOB1, BTG1 and BTG4 showed significant associations with survival outcome of different subtypes of breast cancer. Decreased BTG2 was related with poor relapse free survival (RFS) in all subtypes of breast cancer. Especially, besides RFS, reduced BTG2 also indicated worse overall survival and distant metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients who were classified as luminal A. Significant prognostic effects of the whole APRO family were also found in lung adenocarcinoma, but not in squamous cell lung carcinoma. In addition, potential correlations between some APRO family members and survival outcomes were also observed in ovarian, colorectal and brain cancer. Some members of APRO family showed significant expression differences between cancer and normal tissues, and could be prognostic biomarkers for defined cancer types.",breast_neoplasms

Patients who had MRI before and after NAC between June 2014 and August 2015 were identified in a prospective database after IRB approval. Post-NAC MRI of the breast and axillary nodes was correlated with residual disease on final pathology. Pathologic complete response was defined as absence of invasive and in situ disease. We analyzed 129 breast cancers. Median patient age was 50.8 years (range 27.2 to 80.6 years). Tumors were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplified in 52 of 129 (40%), estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative in 45 of 129 (35%), and triple negative in 32 of 129 (25%), with respective pCR rates of 50%, 9%, and 31%.

Axillary nodes were abnormal on pre-NAC MRI in 97 patients; 65 had biopsy-confirmed metastases. The nodes normalized on post-NAC MRI in 33 of 65 (51%); axillary pCR was present in 22 of 33 (67%). In 32 patients with proven nodal metastases and abnormal nodes on post-NAC MRI, 11 achieved axillary pCR. In 32 patients with normal nodes on pre- and post-NAC MRI, 6 (19%) had metastasis on final pathology.

We performed a retrospective case-control study in a population of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1999 and January 2014 and who had mastectomies with IBR by LDF without prostheses. We paired 29 patients who needed postoperative radiotherapy to 58 control patients who did not. These patients responded to a questionnaire to evaluate tolerance and their satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the reconstruction. In total, 86.2% of all patients reported ""very good"" or ""good"" overall aesthetic satisfaction. Consistency was judged as ""very good"" or ""good"" by 82.7% of control patients and by 93.1% of case patients. No statistically significant differences were identified between the two groups with regard to reconstruction results. The number of surgical procedures needed did not differ significantly between the two groups. In our study, IBR by LDF appeared to have excellent tolerance to subsequent radiotherapy, the latter having no impact on patient aesthetic satisfaction.

Patients with CC or LC and DM2 on MF were compared to controls taking any medication except MF. Recurrences, metastases, secondary cancers, survival and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were compared using t test and chi-squared test. Inclusion criteria were based on MF use, CC or LC diagnosis and DM2. For CC, the MF group noted fewer deaths (48% versus 76%, P < 0.001), recurrences (4% versus 19%, P = 0.002), metastases (23% versus 46%, P = 0.001), better 5-year survival rates (57% versus 37%, P = 0.004), overall survival years (5.7 versus 4.1, P = 0.007) and greater carcinoembryonic antigen decrease (72% versus 47%, P = 0.015). MF was associated with improved 5-year survival rates (29% versus 15%, P = 0.023) and overall survival years (3.4 versus 1.8, P < 0.001) in LC. Our study shows that MF therapy is associated with significantly better prognosis in patients with CC and improved survival in LC. Patients with CC on MF had fewer recurrences and metastases.

28915803,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP/ACP5), a metalloenzyme that is characteristic for its expression in activated osteoclasts and in macrophages, has recently gained considerable focus as a driver of metastasis and was associated with clinically relevant parameters of cancer progression and cancer aggressiveness. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with different TRAP expression levels (overexpression and knockdown) were generated and characterized for protein expression and activity levels. Functional cell experiments, such as proliferation, migration and invasion assays were performed as well as global phosphoproteomic and proteomic analysis was conducted to connect molecular perturbations to the phenotypic changes. We identified an association between metastasis-related properties of TRAP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and a TRAP-dependent regulation of Transforming growth factor (TGF²) pathway proteins and Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). Overexpression of TRAP increased anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent cell growth and proliferation, induced a more elongated cellular morphology and promoted cell migration and invasion. Migration was increased in the presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins osteopontin and fibronectin and the basement membrane proteins collagen IV and laminin I. TRAP-induced properties were reverted upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRAP or treatment with the small molecule TRAP inhibitor 5-PNA. Global phosphoproteomics and proteomics analyses identified possible substrates of TRAP phosphatase activity or signaling intermediates and outlined a TRAP-dependent regulation of proteins involved in cell adhesion and ECM organization. Upregulation of TGF² isoform 2 (TGF²2), TGF² receptor type 1 (T²R1) and Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2), as well as increased intracellular phosphorylation of CD44 were identified upon TRAP perturbation. Functional antibody-mediated blocking and chemical inhibition demonstrated that TRAP-dependent migration and proliferation is regulated via TGF¥â2/T¥âR, whereas proliferation beyond basal levels is regulated through CD44. Altogether, TRAP promotes metastasis-related cell properties in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells via TGF¥â2/T¥âR and",breast_neoplasms
28914645,"Notch signaling is a highly evolutionarily conserved cell-to-cell communication system that is involved in a number of pivotal cellular processes, such as development, stem cell maintenance, cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, and death. Much progress has been made in understanding Notch signaling. This review will focus on the role of canonical Notch signaling pathway in breast cancer cause and progressing. In this review, we will discuss the results of the studies using drugs, which target the Notch pathway. Notch sustains a proliferative signaling and protects from apoptosis, favors the angiogenic switch, the chemoresistance and radioresistance, controls the cancer stemness, and induces a prometastatic phenotype. Therefore, Notch-signaling represented an interesting target in the strategy against cancer growth.",breast_neoplasms
28912152,"Obesity is a consideration in the pharmacologic intervention for estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+) breast cancer risk. Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR) have demonstrated different effects on breast cancer risk in relation to estrogen receptor (ER) status, but the results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, the situation in Chinese women remains unclear. We conducted a case-control study including 1,439 breast cancer cases in Northern and Eastern China. Both ER and progesterone receptor (PR) statuses were available for 1,316 cases. Associations between body size-related factors and breast cancer risk defined by receptor status were assessed by multiple polytomous unconditional logistic regression analysis. Body mass index and WHR were positively associated with overall breast cancer risk. Body mass index was positively associated with both ER+/PR positive (PR+) and ER negative (ER-)/PR negative(PR-) subtype risks, although only significantly for ER+/PR+ subtype. Waist-hip ratio was only positively correlated with ER-/PR- subtype risk, although independent of BMI. Body mass index was positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- subtypes in premenopausal women, whereas WHR was inversely correlated with ER+/PR- and positively with ER-/PR- subtype risks. Among postmenopausal women, WHR >0.85 was associated with increased risk of ER-/PR- subtype. Both general and central obesity contribute to breast cancer risk, with different effects on specific subtypes. General obesity, indicated by BMI, is more strongly associated with ER+/PR+ subtype, especially among premenopausal women, whereas central obesity, indicated by WHR, is more specific for ER-/PR- subtype, independent of menopausal status. These results suggest that different chemoprevention strategies may be appropriate in selected individuals. The results of this study suggest that general and central obesity may play different roles in different breast cancer subtypes, supporting the hypothesis that obesity affects breast carcinogenesis via complex molecular interconnections, beyond the impact of estrogens. The results also imply that different chemoprevention strategies may be appropriate for selected individuals, highlighting the need to be particularly aware of women with a high waist/hip ratio but normal body mass index. Given the lack of any proven pharmacologic intervention for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, stricter weight-control measures may be advised in these individuals.",breast_neoplasms
28912071,"It is controversial whether sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is adequate in breast cancer patients who become cN0 after primary chemotherapy. To address this we retrospectively compared outcomes in T2 cases given primary chemotherapy, comparing those given axillary dissection (AD) with those given SNB but no AD if sentinel nodes were clinically negative post-chemotherapy. We examined overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and axillary failure in 317 consecutive cT2 cN0/1 patients given primary chemotherapy followed by quadrantectomy/mastectomy, between January 2002 and December 2007. The approach to the axilla changed over time allowing division into three groups: 101 (31.9%) given upfront AD; 139 (43.8%) given SNB?+?AD; and 77 (24.3%) given SNB only because the SNs were negative. After median follow-ups of 92 (AD), 99 (SNB?+?AD) and 72 months (SNB-only), OS (p?=?0.131) and DFS (p?=?0.087) did not differ between the 3 groups, or between SNB-only and the ypN1 and ypN0 subgroups of SNB?+?AD, or between the cN0 and cN1 subgroups (before chemotherapy) of the SNB-only group. No SNB-only patient had axillary failure. OS (p?=?0.004) and DFS (p?=?0.002) were better in patients with complete response than those with partial response or stable/progressive disease. SNB is adequate in T2 patients who are cN0 after primary chemotherapy, irrespective of axillary status before. Better outcomes after complete pathological remission confirm the prognostic importance of response to primary chemotherapy, and suggest that all T2 patients should receive primary chemotherapy.",breast_neoplasms
28911092,"Recent breast cancer treatment guidelines recommend that higher-risk premenopausal patients should receive ovarian function suppression (OFS) as part of adjuvant endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is also given, it is uncertain whether to select concurrent or sequential OFS initiation. We analyzed 1872 patients enrolled in the randomized phase III TEXT and SOFT trials who received adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and upon randomization to an OFS-containing adjuvant endocrine therapy, initiated gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonist triptorelin. Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was compared between patients who received OFS concurrently with chemotherapy in TEXT (n?=?1242) versus sequentially post-chemotherapy in SOFT (n?=?630). Because timing of trial enrollment relative to adjuvant chemotherapy differed, we implemented landmark analysis re-defining BCFI beginning 1?year after final dose of chemotherapy (median, 15.5 and 8.1?months from enrollment to landmark in TEXT and SOFT, respectively). As a non-randomized treatment comparison, we implemented comparative-effectiveness propensity score methodology with weighted Cox modeling. Distributions of several clinico-pathologic characteristics differed between groups. Patients who were premenopausal post-chemotherapy in SOFT were younger on average. The median duration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 18?weeks in both groups. There were 231 (12%) BC events after post-landmark median follow-up of about 5?years. Concurrent use of triptorelin with chemotherapy was not associated with a significant difference in post-landmark BCFI compared with sequential triptorelin post-chemotherapy, either in the overall population (HR?=?1.11, 95% CI 0.72-1.72; P?=?0.72; 4-year BCFI 89% in both groups), or in the subgroup of 692 women?<40?years at diagnosis (HR?=?1.13, 95% CI 0.69-1.84) who are less likely to develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Based on comparative-effectiveness modeling of TEXT and SOFT after about 5?years median follow-up, with limited statistical power especially for the subgroup?<40?years, neither detrimental nor beneficial effect of concurrent administration of OFS with chemotherapy on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy that includes chemotherapy was detected.

28911065,"Significant adverse events (AE) during cancer therapy disrupt treatment and escalate to emergency admissions. Approaches to improve the timeliness and accuracy of AE reporting may improve safety and reduce health service costs. Reporting AE via patient reported outcomes (PROs), can improve clinician-patient communication and making data available to clinicians in 'real-time' using electronic PROs (ePROs) could potentially transform clinical practice by providing easily accessible records to guide treatment decisions. This manuscript describes the development of eRAPID (electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice) is a National Institute for Health Research-funded programme, a system for patients to self-report and manage AE online during and after cancer treatment. A multidisciplinary team of IT experts, staff and patients developed using agile principles a secure web application interface (QStore) between an existing online questionnaire builder (QTool) displaying real-time ePRO data to clinicians in the electronic patient record at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Hierarchical algorithms were developed corresponding to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading using the QTool question dependency function. Patient advocates (N?=?9), patients (N?=?13), and staff (N?=?19) usability tested the system reporting combinations of AE. The eRAPID system allows patients to report AE from home on PC, tablet or any web enabled device securely during treatment. The system generates immediate self-management advice for low or moderate AE and for severe AE advice to contact the hospital immediately. Clinicians can view patient AE data in the electronic patient record and receive email notifications when patients report severe AE. Evaluation of the system in a randomised controlled trial in breast, gynaecological and colorectal cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy is currently underway. To adapt eRAPID for different treatment groups, pilot studies are being undertaken with patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy and upper gastrointestinal surgery. ISRCTN88520246.",breast_neoplasms
28911063,"The role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer has been extensively studied over the last decade. High TILs levels have been associated with pathological response rate in the neoadjuvant setting and with better outcomes in the adjuvant setting. However, little attention has been paid to changes in TILs and residual TIL levels after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We investigated TIL levels before, after chemotherapy, and their dynamics during treatment; and we assessed the correlation of these levels with response to NAC and prognosis. We identified 175 patients with primary HER2-positive breast cancers receiving NAC+/- trastuzumab between 2002 and 2011. Microbiopsy specimens and paired surgical samples were evaluated for stromal lymphocyte infiltration. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the association of clinical and pathological factors with pathological complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival. Baseline TIL levels were not significantly associated with pCR. TIL levels decreased during treatment in 78% of the patients. The magnitude of the decrease was strongly associated with pCR. After chemotherapy, TIL levels were high in tumors displaying aggressive patterns (high residual cancer burden score, mitotic index?>22, tumor cellularity?>5%). In the population with residual disease, TIL levels?>25% at the end of NAC were significantly associated with an adverse outcome (TILs?>25%, HR?=?7.98, P?=?0.009) after multivariate analyses including BMI, post-NAC mitotic index and tumor grade. A decrease in TIL levels during chemotherapy was positively associated with response to treatment. In tumor failing to achieve pCR, post-NAC lymphocytic infiltration was associated with higher residual tumor burden and adverse clinical outcome. Further studies are required to characterize immune infiltration in residual disease to identify candidates who could benefit from second-line therapy trials including immune checkpoint inhibitors.",breast_neoplasms
28903742,"The belief that early detection is the best protection against cancer underlies cancer screening. Emerging research now suggests harms associated with early detection may sometimes outweigh the benefits. Governments, cancer agencies, and organizations that publish screening guidelines have found it is difficult to ""un-ring the bell"" on the message that ""early detection is your best protection"" because of its widespread communication and enduring resonance. This study explores affective factors-and their interplay with relevant analytical factors-in public/laypersons' decision making about cancer screening. A total of 93 people (47 men, 46 women) attended focus groups about, respectively, prostate cancer screening and breast cancer screening in two Canadian cities. Affective factors were a major influence on many focus group participants' decision making about cancer screening, including fear of cancer and a generalized enthusiasm for prevention/screening, and they were often inspired by anecdotes about the cancer experiences of family and friends. Affect also existed alongside more analytical factors including assessments of reduced risk in the management of any cancer diagnosis if caught early, and, for men, the belief that an unreliable test is ""better than nothing,"" and that men deserve prostate cancer screening because women have breast and cervical cancer screening. Affective factors were particularly noticeable in the sub-groups most supportive of screening and the ""early detection"" message: older women who felt that mammogram screening should begin at age 40 rather than 50, and older men who felt that prostate cancer screening should be expanded beyond its current unorganized, opportunistic usage. In contrast, younger participants displayed less affective attachments to ""early detection"" messages and had greater concerns about harms of screening and were more receptive to nuanced messages informed by evidence. Policymakers attempting to communicate more nuanced versions of the ""early detection"" message need to understand the role of affect alongside other judgments brought into laypersons' decision making processes and anticipate how affective responses to their messages will be shaped, transformed, and potentially subverted by external forces beyond their control. Particularly overt external factors are campaigns by cancer advocacy organizations actively promoting breast and prostate cancer awareness and screening to younger women and men using affectively-charged messages.",breast_neoplasms
28902882,"There are inconsistent and limited data regarding the risk of myeloid neoplasms (MN) among breast cancer survivors who received radiotherapy (RT) in the absence of chemotherapy. Concern about subsequent MN might influence the decision to use adjuvant RT for women with localized disease. As patients with therapy-related MN have generally poor outcomes, the presumption of subsequent MN being therapy-related could affect treatment recommendations. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to study older women with in-situ or stage 1-3 breast cancer diagnosed 2001-2009 who received surgery. Chemotherapy and RT were ascertained using Medicare claims, and new MN diagnoses were captured using both SEER registry and Medicare claims. We excluded women who received chemotherapy for initial treatment, and censored at receipt of subsequent chemotherapy. Competing-risk survival analysis was used to assess the association between RT and risk of subsequent MN adjusting for relevant characteristics. Median follow-up for 60,426 eligible patients was 68 months (interquartile range, 46 to 92 months), with 47.6% receiving RT. In total, 316 patients (0.52%) were diagnosed with MN; the cumulative incidence per 10,000 person-years was 10.6 vs 9.0 among RT-treated vs non-RT-treated women, respectively (p = .004); the increased risk of subsequent MN persisted in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.80). The results were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. Our data suggest that RT is associated with a significant risk of subsequent MN among older breast cancer survivors, though the absolute risk increase is very small. These findings suggest the benefits of RT outweigh the risks of development of subsequent MN.",breast_neoplasms
28901319,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women, and the tumor cells' invasion and metastasis is the main cause of death. Recent reports showed that Twist, a transcription factor, plays multiple roles in breast cancer initiation, progress, and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms of Twist in tumor invasion and metastasis of breast cancer still remain unclear. Here, we examined the correlation between Twist, E-cadherin, and estrogen receptor (ER) in promoting invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells and tissues. The mRNA and protein expression of Twist, E-cadherin, and ER in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and ZR-75-30) and human invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues from 32 patients were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Expression of Twist in cells with high ability of invasion and metastasis was higher than that in MCF-7 cell line which has low ability of invasion and metastasis, while the expression of ER and E-cadherin was much more higher in MCF-7 cell line than in other cells. IHC showed that the expression rate of Twist in IDC tissues and adjacent tissues was 84.38% and 31.25% and the positive expression of E-cadherin and ER was 21.88% and 40.63% in IDC tissues and 81.25% and 84.38% in adjacent tissues, respectively. Interestingly, overexpression of Twist promoted cellular invasion and metastasis and decreased the expression of E-cadherin, ER, AKT, and p-AKT in HEK-293 cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Twist was upregulated in high invasion and metastasis cell lines as well as IDC tissues companioned with downregulated expression of E-cadherin and ER, which provides important clues for the deeper study of breast cancer.",breast_neoplasms

Our objective was to systematically evaluate associations of 2-pore domain potassium channel gene expression and DNA methylation with triple-negative subtype in The Cancer Genome Atlas invasive breast cancer dataset. Methylation and expression data for all fifteen 2-pore domain potassium family genes were examined for 1040 women, and associations with triple-negative subtype (vs. luminal A) were evaluated using age/race adjusted generalized-linear models, with Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds. Subtype associated CpG loci were evaluated for functionality related to expression using Spearman's correlation. -8). Significantly negatively correlated expression patterns that were differentially observed in triple-negative vs. luminal A subtype were demonstrated for: KCNK2 (gene body: cg04923840, cg13916421), KCNK5 (gene body: cg05255811, cg18705155, cg09130674, cg21388745, cg00859574) and KCNK9 (TSS1500: cg21415530, cg12175729; KCNK9/TRAPPC9 intergenic region: cg17336929, cg25900813, cg03919980). CpG loci listed for KCNK5 and KCNK9 all showed relative hypomethylation for probability of triple-negative vs. luminal A subtype.

Oncotype DX RSs were collected and modified Magee equation RSs were calculated in 163 low-grade invasive breast carcinomas, including 105 CILCs, 41 ITCs, and 17 IMCs. In total, 105 (64.4%) cases had an Oncotype DX RS less than 18, 56 (34.4%) were between 18 and 30, and two (1.2%) were more than 30. Of the cases, 124 (76.1%) had a modified Magee RS less than 18, 39 (23.9%) were between 18 and 30, and no case was more than 30. The overall agreement between Oncotype DX RS and modified Magee RS risk categories was 68.7%. Two CILCs with an Oncotype DX RS more than 30 had modified Magee equation RSs of 20.3 and 20.0, respectively, and both had not shown recurrent disease. Performing Oncotype DX on low-grade invasive carcinomas is unlikely to provide additional useful information beyond Magee equation RS, and eliminating Oncotype DX from these cases could lead to substantial cost savings.",breast_neoplasms

Longer follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor-positive tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology). To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is noninferior to that of women treated with axillary dissection. The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and community medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases. All patients had planned lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited. The primary outcome was overall survival with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival. Among 891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) completed the trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93-10.34 years), the 10-year overall survival was 86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95% CI, 0-1.16]; noninferiority P?=?.02).

Clinical notes, imaging findings, and pathology outcomes were reviewed. One hundred eighteen women (mean age, 49 years; range, 23-82 years) underwent MRI for evaluation of nipple discharge, 105 (89.0%) of whom had surgical excision or at least 2-year imaging follow-up. A total of six patients (6/105; 5.7%) were diagnosed with malignancy (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or invasive malignancy).

An additional three patients (without suspicious findings at MRI) were diagnosed with malignancy at surgical excision, all of which were grade 1 DCIS. For patients with negative MRI findings (BI-RADS category 1, 2, or 3), the negative predictive value of MRI for malignancy was 96.2% (75/78). In women with nipple discharge and negative or inconclusive mammography findings, the risk of malignancy is low, at 5.7%.

In breast cancer patients who underwent NAC between 2011 and 2013, we evaluated residual tumor measurements obtained with CESM and full-field digital mammography (FFDM). We determined the concordance between the methods, as well as their level of agreement with the pathology. Three radiologists analyzed eight CESM and FFDM measurements separately, considering the size of the residual tumor at its largest diameter and correlating it with that determined in the pathological analysis. Interobserver agreement was also evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were higher for CESM than for FFDM (83.33%, 100%, 100%, and 66% vs. 50%, 50%, 50%, and 25%, respectively). The CESM measurements showed a strong, consistent correlation with the pathological findings (correlation coefficient = 0.76-0.92; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.692-0.886). The correlation between the FFDM measurements and the pathological findings was not statistically significant, with questionable consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.488-0.598). Agreement with the pathological findings was narrower for CESM measurements than for FFDM measurements. Interobserver agreement was higher for CESM than for FFDM (0.94 vs. 0.88).

28893225,"Early detection of breast cancer using screening mammography provides an opportunity for treatment which can lead to significantly improved outcomes. Despite considerable efforts having been made, the rate at which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter respectfully referred to as Aboriginal) women in Western Australia participate in BreastScreen WA's screening mammogram program remains below that for the overall female population of Western Australia. This study aimed to examine perspectives on breast screening amongst Aboriginal women in Western Australia. We explored the factors which impact on participation in breast screening and sought to identify potential initiatives to address lower participation in screening. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and yarning sessions were conducted with a total of 65 research participants. They were all Aboriginal and comprised consumers and health professionals from locations across the state. Our findings show that research participants generally were willing to have a mammogram. Key reasons given were having a genetic predisposition to breast cancer and a perception of investing in health for the sake of the next generation, as well as personal well-being. Barriers identified included lack of education about or understanding of screening, inadequacies in cultural appropriateness in the screening program, cultural beliefs around cancer in general and breast cancer in particular, and competing health and life priorities. However, many enablers were identified which can serve as potential strategies to assuage fear and increase screening uptake. These included increased education delivered by respected Aboriginal women, culturally appropriate promotion and the provision of care and support from other women in the community. The higher participation rates for Aboriginal women in Western Australia than are found for Aboriginal women nationally demonstrate the success of the strategies put in place by BreastScreen WA. These efforts must be supported and existing policies and practices enhanced to address the limitations in the existing program. Only by implementing and evaluating such initiatives and making breast screening programs more accessible to Aboriginal women can the current disparity between the screening participation rates of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women be reduced.",breast_neoplasms

Patients filled out weekly questionnaires for 13 weeks, then monthly for two years. The questionnaires included a subscale for PD on the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. We used generalized estimating equations and multivariable logistic regression analyses. At baseline, 290 patients (27%) had a high level of PD. For the entire group, the level of PD remained constant over time. The majority of patients with a low level of PD at baseline remained at a low level during follow-up. In patients with a high level of PD at baseline, the mean level of PD decreased after treatment and stabilized around the cutoff level. Female patients, higher age, worse performance, lower pain score and worse self-reported QoL were associated with an increased chance of PD, although the model showed moderate discriminative power. A substantial proportion of patients had a high level of PD before and after radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Most patients who reported high levels of PD when referred for palliative radiotherapy remained at high levels thereafter. Therefore, screening of PD prior to treatment seems appropriate, in order to select patients requiring intervention.",breast_neoplasms

28889078,"To evaluate whether the association between breast cancer (BC) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure is modulated by selected polymorphisms in iAs metabolism. A population based case-control (1016/1028) study was conducted in Northern Mexico. Urinary arsenic metabolites were measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Metabolites percentages and methylation ratios, were estimated. Genotypes of selected polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination. The interaction between polymorphisms and iAs metabolites percentages and methylation ratios on BC was assessed with unconditional logistic regression models. A significant interaction (p=0.002) between MTR c.2756A>G polymorphism and percentage dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) on BC was found; BC risk related with %DMA was lower in AG+GG carriers than in AA carriers. No other significant interactions were found. MTR c.2756A>G polymorphism may confer protection for BC associated with iAs exposure. Further research is warranted to elucidate the potential involvement of other polymorphisms in iAs-related BC.",breast_neoplasms
28887687,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most prevalent in young women of African ancestry (WAA) compared to women of other ethnicities. Recent studies found a correlation between high expression of the transcription factor Kaiso, TNBC aggressiveness, and ethnicity. However, little is known about Kaiso expression and localization patterns in TNBC tissues of WAA. Herein, we analyze Kaiso expression patterns in TNBC tissues of African (Nigerian), Caribbean (Barbados), African American (AA), and Caucasian American (CA) women. Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) TNBC tissue blocks from Nigeria and Barbados were utilized to construct a Nigerian/Barbadian tissue microarray (NB-TMA). This NB-TMA and a commercially available TMA comprising AA and CA TNBC tissues (AA-CA-YTMA) were subjected to immunohistochemistry to assess Kaiso expression and subcellular localization patterns, and correlate Kaiso expression with TNBC clinical features. Nigerian and Barbadian women in our study were diagnosed with TNBC at a younger age than AA and CA women. Nuclear and cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was observed in all tissues analyzed. Analysis of Kaiso expression in the NB-TMA and AA-CA-YTMA revealed that nuclear Kaiso H scores were significantly higher in Nigerian, Barbadian, and AA women compared with CA women. However, there was no statistically significant difference in nuclear Kaiso expression between Nigerian versus Barbadian women, or Barbadian versus AA women. High levels of nuclear Kaiso expression were detected in patients with a higher degree of African heritage compared to their Caucasian counterparts, suggesting a role for Kaiso in TNBC racial disparity.",breast_neoplasms
28886475,"Women with a strong family history of breast cancer (BC) and without a known gene mutation have an increased risk of developing BC. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of screening using annual mammography with or without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for these women outside the general population screening program. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was conducted using IPD from six prospective screening trials that had included women at increased risk for BC: only women with a strong familial risk for BC and without a known gene mutation were included in this analysis. A generalised linear mixed model was applied to estimate and compare screening accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) for annual mammography with or without MRI. There were 2226 women (median age: 41 years, interquartile range 35-47) with 7478 woman-years of follow-up, with a BC rate of 12 (95% confidence interval 9.3-14) in 1000 woman-years. Mammography screening had a sensitivity of 55% (standard error of mean [SE] 7.0)?and a specificity of 94% (SE 1.3). Screening with MRI alone had a sensitivity of 89% (SE 4.6) and a specificity of 83% (SE 2.8). Adding MRI to mammography increased sensitivity to 98% (SE 1.8, P?<?0.01 compared to mammography alone)?but lowered specificity to 79% (SE 2.7, P?<?0.01 compared with mammography alone). In this population of women with strong familial BC risk but without a known gene mutation, in whom BC incidence was high both before and after age 50, adding MRI to mammography substantially increased screening sensitivity but also decreased its specificity.",breast_neoplasms
28886076,"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an innate immune system DNA-receptor that regulates tumor invasion and immunity in vitro. Low tumor TLR9 expression has been associated with poor survival in Caucasian patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). African American (AA) patients with TNBC have worse prognosis than Caucasians but whether this is due to differences in tumor biology remains controversial. We studied the prognostic significance of tumor Toll like receptor-9 (TLR9) protein expression among African American (AA) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Germline TLR9 variants in European Americans (EAs) and AAs were investigated, to determine their contribution to AA breast cancer risk. TLR9 expression was studied with immunohistochemistry in archival tumors. Exome Variant Server and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to determine the genetic variation in the general EA and AA populations, and AA breast cancer cases. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were compared between EAs (n = 4300), AAs (n = 2203), and/or AA breast cancer cases (n = 131). Thirty-two TLR9 variants had a statistically significant MAF difference between general EAs and AAs. Twenty-one of them affect a CpG site. Rs352140, a variant previously associated with protection from breast cancer, is more common in EAs than AAs (p = 2.20E-16). EAs had more synonymous alleles, while AAs had more rare coding alleles. Similar analyses comparing AA breast cancer cases with AA controls did not reveal any variant class differences; however, three previously unreported TLR9 variants were associated with late onset breast cancer. Although not statistically significant, rs352140 was observed less frequently in AA cases compared to controls. Tumor TLR9 protein expression was not associated with prognosis. Tumor TLR9 expression is not associated with prognosis in AA TNBC. Significant differences were detected in TLR9 variant MAFs between EAs and AAs. They may affect TLR9 expression and function. Rs352140, which may protect from breast cancer, is 1.6 X more common among EAs. These findings call for a detailed analysis of the contribution of TLR9 to breast cancer pathophysiology and health disparities.",breast_neoplasms
28885214,"Breast Carcinoma is the most common malign tumor disease in women. 20-30% of these tumors have to be treated by removing all of the breast tissue. After that kind of therapeutic procedure, most of the women are severely traumatized and ask for reconstruction. The goldstandard of breast reconstruction is the free perforator flap from the lower abdomen (DIEAP-flap), which can provide body-own tissue and natural shape for the reconstructed breast.Many studies evaluate the shape of the reconstructed breast but neglect the skin sensitivity. Claim of this study was to compare this important part of reconstruction on two different techniques of mastectomy. In this retrospective study we evaluated which technique of mastectomy and breast reconstruction with DIEAP-Flap offers the highest outcome for sensibility of the reconstructed breast. Skin sparing mastectomy was compared with conventional mastectomy and the results of skin sensitivity were measured. Ten patients underwent breast reconstruction with free abdominal perforator flap between 2011 and 2015 after conventional mastectomy (CM) and were compared with ten patients, who had a skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate reconstruction by DIEAP-flap during the same time interval. These two groups were matched by age, height, weight and the time between reconstruction and examination. The sensitivity of the skin was measured by Semmes-Weinstein-Filaments in the strength beginning from 0,07?g till 300?g for deep sensation. The logarithmic profile of these measurements had been transferred into a continuous data system beginning from 1 point, which stands for no sensation, till 7 points for pressure threshold of 0,07?g. Patients who underwent DIEAP-reconstruction after skin sparing mastectomy showed a higher sensation at all regions of the new breast in comparison to reconstruction after conventional mastectomy, beginning from the nipple to the areola and the breast skin. The results in the CM-group were 1.0 points at the mamilla, 1.33?pts. at the areola and 1.78?pts. at the breast skin. In the SSM-group, the findings were 3?pts. at the mamilla, 3.25?pts. at the areola and 5.25?pts. at the breast skin. The skin sparing mastectomy combined with immediate reconstruction by DIEAP-flap provides an excellent therapeutic option for patients, who are suitable for this technique, which takes into account not only the form but also the sensitivity of the breast.",breast_neoplasms

We defined influenza among a nationwide cohort of 87,843 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014, based on HIRA claim data. Descriptive statistics were calculated to estimate the frequency of influenza disease using diagnostic code and utilization pattern at medical institutions. Two thousand four hundred breast cancer survivors (2.7%) were diagnosed with influenza. The overall frequency of influenza increased from November (n=98) and peaked in February (n=1,745). Over 60% (2,693) of claims for influenza disease treatment were in the clinic, whereas general hospitals accounted for 22.0% (873). Among 3,967 claims, admission rate was 7.6% (n=301) and the average length of hospitalization was 4.7 days. Elderly breast cancer survivors over 70 years old had the longest length of hospitalization at 5.9 days. Breast cancer survivors are more susceptible to influenza than non-cancer survivors.

DCIS incidence peaks in women aged 60-69 years. DCIS incidence has not stabilized despite screening being well established for over 20 years, and participation rates in the target age range remaining stable.

Subjects for this community-based trial were recruited from the Philadelphia area through active (mailings) and passive (printed materials and Web site) recruitment strategies. In addition, education sessions coordinated through partner hospitals in communities with a predominantly minority population were conducted to increase awareness of lymphedema in survivors of breast cancer. Women who were interested in the study were screened for lymphedema via telephone questionnaire and invited to see a study-related certified lymphedema therapist to confirm the presence of lymphedema. Screening was conducted among 2295 women: 628 were eligible, 450 consented, and 351 were randomized. Minority women comprised 38% of the study population. Letters to women on state and hospital registries resulted in a 0.4% randomization rate; education sessions yielded a 10% randomization rate.

Based on the available literature on online registry-based tools and genomic assays, we evaluated whether these online tools could be valid and accurate alternatives to genomic and molecular profiling of the individual breast tumour in aiding therapeutic decisions, particularly in patients with early ER-positive breast cancer. Early breast cancer is currently considered a systemic disease and a complex ecosystem with behaviour determined by the complex genetic and molecular signatures of the tumour cells, mammary stem cells, microenvironment and host immune system. We anticipate that molecular profiling will continue to evolve, expanding beyond the primary tumour to include the tumour microenvironment, cancer stem cells and host immune system.

The patients are at risk of developing sexual hormone deficiency and impaired fertility. This prospective cohort study addresses predictive parameters of ovarian reserve after chemotherapy. Fifty-one premenopausal women (28-46?years) with primary breast cancer were included in the trial. All of them received anthracycline-based chemotherapy (n?=?18), or combinations with taxanes (n?=?30), or anthracycline-free chemotherapy (n?=?3). Changes in hormone levels (LH, FSH, E2 and Anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH)), antral follicle count (AFC), and amenorrhea were determined before (V1), and 6, 12 and 24?months after the initiation of chemotherapy (V2-V4). Quality of life parameters were evaluated. The additional impact of parity, BMI, and smoking on ovarian reserve was also assessed. AFC and AMH fell very markedly after chemotherapy and did not return to pre-treatment levels until V4. A significant positive correlation was noted in AFC before and 1?year after chemotherapy. AMH levels at V2-V4 were significantly correlated with those registered at V1. AFC and AMH were negatively correlated with age. Continued smoking had a significant detrimental effect on AFC after 24?months. LH and FSH levels increased between V1 and V2 and fell at V3 and V4, but stayed above pre-chemotherapy values. Two years after the start of chemotherapy 31/51 patients were amenorrhoic while 17 resumed their menstrual cycle; this was not influenced by the type of chemotherapy or age. Non-smokers were 13 times more likely to resume their menstruation than smokers. Quality of life (QL) was significantly lower 6?months after the initiation of chemotherapy. QL at one and 2?years after chemotherapy did not differ significantly from pre-chemotherapy scores. Our study contributes to a better understanding and prediction of ovarian reserve in young early breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

To evaluate lymph edema volume and treatment outcome, an easy to use, objective quantification method of arm volume is necessary. Most often, water displacement is used to measure arm volume, as it is an easy and robust method that can be performed at any place with a simple equipment. However, when using water displacement, no exact localization of volume difference can be seen. To accurately measure hand and forearm volumes separately, an in-house-developed device was constructed for an accurate landmark placement. An in-house developed measurement tool was used for placing artificial landmarks proximal to the wrist crease on ten healthy subjects. Three-dimensional (3D) images of the hand and forearm were acquired, and volume measurements of the hand and forearm were performed. Measurements were repeated to investigate the intra- and inter-rater variability caused by the landmark placement. Measuring volume of the hand and forearm while using artificially placed landmarks turned out to be a highly reproducible, quick, and easy procedure.

The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy for stage II disease remains controversial, and patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy are at risk of late complications, including radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs), that may reduce the overall benefit of treatment. We assess the risk of predicted SMNs following adjuvant proton radiation therapy compared with photon radiation therapy after resection of stage II thymic malignancies to determine whether proton therapy improves the risk-benefit ratio. Ten consecutive patients treated with double-scattered proton beam radiation therapy (DS-PBT) were prospectively enrolled in an institutional review board-approved proton registry study. All patients were treated with DS-PBT. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for comparison were generated. SMN risk was calculated based on organ equivalent dose. Patients had a median age of 65?years (range, 25-77?years), and 60% were men. All patients had stage II disease, and many had close or positive margins (60%).

This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of women who underwent mammography screening in a mobile unit versus those who underwent mammography screening at a cancer center. In this retrospective study, we analyzed all screening mammography examinations performed in a mobile unit in 2014 (n = 1433 examinations). For comparison, we randomized and reviewed an equivalent number of screening mammography examinations performed at our cancer center in 2014 (n = 1434 examinations). BI-RADS assessment, adherence to follow-up, biopsies performed, cancer detection rate, and sociodemographic variables were recorded. An independent-samples t test was conducted to identify potential differences in age between cancer center patients and mobile unit patients. Chi-square analyses were used to test for associations between location and factors such as health insurance, race, marital status, geographic area, adherence to screening guidelines, recall rate, adherence to follow-up, and cancer detection rates. 2 = 22.75, p < 0.001) with patients using the mobile unit less likely to return for additional imaging (cancer center = 2.65%, mobile unit = 17.03%). Significant differences were found among patients visiting the cancer center versus the mobile mammography van. The cancer center's population is older and more adherent to guidelines, whereas the mobile mammography population exhibited greater racial and marital diversity, higher recall rate, and lack of adherence to follow-up recommendations. By identifying these characteristics, we can develop programs and materials that meet these populations' needs and behaviors, ultimately increasing mammography screening and follow-up rates among underserved populations.",breast_neoplasms

Sixty-five patients who underwent repeat lumpectomy without radiotherapy after IBTR were retrospectively analyzed. The risk factors of second IBTR, including the breast cancer subtype of IBTR defined by the estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status, were assessed. The median follow-up period was 62 months. The 5-year second IBTR-free survival rate was 83%. Patients with the ER-positive/HER2-negative subtype of IBTR had a significantly better second IBTR-free survival rate than those with other subtypes of IBTR (88% vs. 75%, respectively, p=0.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that the breast cancer subtype of IBTR was a significantly independent predictive factor of second IBTR-free survival (p=0.003). A low-risk group for second IBTR, defined by the breast cancer subtype of IBTR and margin status of primary surgery, was detected (5-year second IBTR-free survival rate: 100%). Patients in the low-risk group defined by the breast cancer subtype of IBTR and margin status of primary surgery could safely undergo repeat lumpectomy without radiotherapy for IBTR.",breast_neoplasms

A 39-year-old female patient was diagnosed with T3N2M0 stage IIIB right breast cancer and underwent right total mastectomy and axillar lymph node dissection. At four years after surgery, she became aware of chest wall pain and diagnostic imaging revealed recurrence in the lung, right thoracic wall and sternum. The recurrent lesions remained stable for 18 months with endocrine therapy. Thereafter, the lesion in the right thoracic wall suddenly became enlarged. Moreover, liver metastasis was confirmed on FDG-PET/CT. She underwent right thoracic wall tumor resection. A biopsy was simultaneously performed to obtain a specimen from the site of liver metastasis. Postoperatively, the right chest wall mass showed obvious intratumoral heterogeneity; squamous differentiation with aggressive features and a papillotubular component similar to the primary tumor. The metastatic liver tumor showed similar pathological features to the primary tumor.

Its nuclear localization and endogenous inhibition of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) are considered crucial for its tumor suppressor activity. However, it remains unclear whether subcellular localization of maspin correlates with HDAC1 expression level in human breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 164 resected specimens of invasive breast carcinoma using antibodies for maspin and HDAC1. Subcellular localization of maspin protein and HDAC1 mRNA expression level in two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) and mammary epithelial cell line (MCF10) were analyzed by immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The frequency of cytoplasmic-only, pancellular (combined nuclear and cytoplasm) and no staining of maspin were 31%, 14.0% and 55%, respectively. The cytoplasmic-only subgroup showed significantly higher histological grade (p=0.004), negative progesterone receptor status (p=0.003) and shorter disease-free survival compared to the pancellular subgroup (p=0.043). High HDAC1 expression was observed in 60% of cases and was significantly correlated with cytoplasmic-only staining compared to pancellular (p<0.001) or no staining (p=0.004). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that maspin protein was localized mainly in the cytoplasm in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, while in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in MCF10A cells. HDAC1 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF10A cells (p<0.001).

This study investigated factors influencing IBC treatment outcomes such as event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Data were collected from 173 patients with stage III non-IBC and 17 patients with IBC diagnosed at the Keck Medical Center and Los Angeles County and University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Medical Center. Cox proportional hazard regression evaluated associations between variables significant for EFS and OS. On multivariate analysis, negative estrogen receptor (ER)status [hazard ratio (HR)=1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.11-3.18, p<0.06) and lack of postoperative radiation treatment (HR=2.07, 95% CI=1.03-4.15, p<0.04) were significant for poorer EFS. High Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) score (HR=2.24, 95% CI=0.79-6.36, p<0.13) and lack of postoperative radiation treatment to the breast (HR=4.39, 95% CI=0.39-49.55, p<0.23) were associated with lower rates of OS.

28870920,"The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes are in charge of degradation of various components of the extracellular matrix and their functional genetic polymorphisms may be associated with cancer susceptibility. The functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of MMP7 (A-181G and C-153T) have been reported to influence the binding capacity of nuclear proteins and may contribute to genetic susceptibility to cancer. In this study, we focused on investigating the contribution of the genotypes of MMP7 (A-181G and C-153T) to breast cancer in Taiwan. These two polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,232 patients with breast cancer and 1,232 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. The odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for age, family history of cancer, smoking and alcohol drinking status for those carrying AG and GG genotypes at MMP7 promoter A-181G were 1.22 (95%CI=0.91-1.63, p=0.2235) and 2.84 (95%CI=1.64-7.48, p=0.0007) respectively, compared to those carrying the wild-type AA genotype. Supporting this finding, the adjusted OR for those carrying the G allele at MMP7 promoter A-181G was 1.57 (95%CI=1.29-1.93, p=0.0008), compared to those carrying the wild-type A allele. There was no polymorphic genotype at MMP7 C-153T found among any of the investigated individuals. Our findings suggest that the MMP7 A-181G polymorphisms may play a role in determining personal cancer susceptibility and GG genotype at MMP7 A-181G may serve as a biomarker for early detection and prediction of breast cancer in Taiwanese.",breast_neoplasms

It was previously reported that increased CXCL8 protein levels occurred in certain patients. In the present study, we examined levels of CXCL8 mRNA in breast cancer tissues and analyzed its levels in correlation to patients' clinical data and 10-year overall survival (OS). Our results clearly demonstrated that the level of CXCL8 mRNA was significantly higher in patients without estrogen receptor expression. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the best cut-off value for CXCL8 expression was 3.095 for predicting patient's OS. The present study demonstrated that higher CXCL8 mRNA levels in breast cancer tissues together with estrogen receptor negativity was associated with significantly shorter OS, and could be applied as a negative risk factor for 10-year OS.",breast_neoplasms

Recently, this extract has been shown to possess anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties, though this mechanism remains unknown. In the current work, we prepared extracts of P. suffruticosa and analyzed their effects on MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. Varying concentrations of an aqueous extract of P. suffruticosa was administered to MDA-MB-231. An MTS assay was used to determine the cell viability. Cytokine production was investigated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Caspase-Glo assays were performed to measure caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 to analyze anti-apoptotic effects. MTS assay for cell viability revealed that the extract increased viability at low concentrations (0.6 mg/ml) and decreased viability observed at concentrations ¡Ã2.5 mg/ml (p<0.01). ELISA for IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-alpha revealed a biphasic dose-response inversely related to viability (p<0.05). IL-24 expression also increased at 2.5 mg/ml and 4.0 mg/ml (p<0.05). Bax levels remained relatively constant while Bcl-2 decreased significantly in all concentrations (p<0.01). Small decreases in Fas ligand levels was observed in parallel with a lack of increase in caspase-8 activity.

The cytolytic activity of NK cells is tightly regulated by inhibitory and activation receptors located in the surface membrane. Lidocaine stimulates the function of NK cells at clinically relevant concentrations. It remains unknown whether this effect of lidocaine has an impact on the expression of surface receptors of NK cells, can uniformly stimulate across different cancer cell lines, and enhances the function of cells obtained during oncological surgery. NK cells from healthy donors and 43 patients who had undergone surgery for cancer were isolated. The function of NK cells was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. NK cells were incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of lidocaine. By flow cytometry, we determined the impact of lidocaine on the expression of galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein3-beta-glucuronosytranferase 1, marker of cell maturation (CD57), killer cell lectin like receptor A, inhibitory (NKG2A) receptors and killer cell lectin like receptor D, activation (NKG2D) receptors of NK cells. Differences in expression at p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Lidocaine increased the expression of NKG2D receptors and stimulated the function of NK cells against ovarian, pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines. Lidocaine also increased the cytolytic activity of NK cells from patients who underwent oncological surgery, except for those who had orthopedic procedures. Lidocaine showed an important stimulatory activity on NK cells. Our findings suggest that lidocaine might be used perioperatively to minimize the impact of surgery on NK cells.",breast_neoplasms

Between June 2012 to October 2015, participants in a cancer staging study underwent full-field digital mammography (FFDM), CEMRI, and CESM. Two readers independently rated FGTV, MBD, and BPE using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) criteria. Inter-reader reliability was estimated using weighted kappa (k) and correlations between BPE, MBD, and FGTV calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Associations with hormonal status were evaluated using multilevel ordinal regression analysis. Of the 96 eligible participants, 66 women (35-77 years) underwent CESM and CEMRI. Reasons for exclusion were declined or withdrawn consent (n=18), inadequate renal function (n=2), claustrophobia (n=2), previous reaction to contrast medium (n=2), mild reaction to contrast medium following CESM (n=2), lack of vascular access (n=1), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=1), CESM equipment failure (n=1), and unclear in one case. Inter-reader agreement was substantial (k=0.67) for CESM BPE, slight (k=0.19) for CEMRI BPE, moderate (k=0.57) for MRI FGTV and fair (k=0.35) for MBD.

However, whether circulating linc-ROR in plasma could be used for breast cancer diagnosis and dynamic monitoring is not clear. The objective of this study is to determine if plasma linc-ROR could be applied as a biomarker for the diagnosis and dynamic monitoring of breast cancer. We tested the expression levels of linc-ROR in 24 pairs of tissue samples and 96 plasma samples from breast cancer patients by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and analyzed the correlation between plasma linc-ROR levels and clinico-pathological characteristics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic power of plasma linc-ROR, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA)153 for breast cancer. Furthermore, we explored the monitoring values of plasma linc-ROR for breast cancer by analyzing the preoperative and postoperative plasma linc-ROR levels of the same patients. The expression levels of linc-ROR were significantly higher in breast cancer tissues and plasma than the levels in the control (P< 0.05). The linc-ROR expression levels in plasma were correlated with lymph node metastasis (P< 0.05), estrogen receptor (ER) (P< 0.05) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P< 0.05). The area under the ROC curve of plasma linc-ROR was 0.758 (sensitivity 80.0%; specificity 73.3%), which was higher than CEA and CA153 values from the same patients obtained. Combination of the linc-ROR with the conventional biomarkers might produce better diagnostic ability. Additionally, the linc-ROR expression levels of plasma in postoperative patients were lower than those in preoperative patients (P< 0.05).

This study is an effort to assess the incidence of complications following parotidectomy and their impact on subjects' QoL. Subjects undergoing parotidectomy for benign neoplasms from 2012 to 2015 were selected and invited to attend our outpatient clinic. After a brief anamnesis, the medical examiners tested their tactile perception and performed the Minor test for FS. Depending on the complications showed, subjects were asked to complete from 1 to 4 questionnaires about their QoL. 76 subjects completed the medical examination. The most frequent complication was the hypo-anaesthesia of the skin (71%). 21 subjects (28%) were positive to the Minor test, while 8 subjects (11%) reported FBS-compatible symptoms. Two subjects (3%) showed a facial nerve paralysis. Free abdominal fat graft was used in 16 subjects (21%) and it was associated with a lower incidence of FS. Surgery of the deep lobe of the parotid was associated with FBS. FBS appears to have a greater influence on subjects' QoL than FS and hypo-anaesthesia of the skin.

We evaluated IHM in RTRs admitted between 2000 and 2013 recorded in the RER database. By using ICD-9-CM codes, the Elixhauser index (EI) was calculated, and cancers were identified and classified as skin cancers (SC), solid organ cancers (SOC) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). IHM was the dependent variable of the multivariate models, while age, gender, EI corrected removing the effect of malignancies (cEI), and different types of cancer were the independent ones. During the examined period, a total of 9,063 admissions in 3,648 RTRs were recorded, of whom 117 died (3.2%). The mean age was 52.9¡¾13.1 years. Cancers were reported in 580 admissions (6.4%), and mean cEI was 3.5¡¾3.4. Deceased RTRs were older, had a higher prevalence of PTLD and SOC, and had a higher cEI than survivors.

The Missouri Cancer Registry wanted to produce data that would be of interest to lawmakers as well as public health officials at the legislative district level on breast cancer, the most common non-skin cancer among females. The aim was to measure and interactively visualize survival data of female breast cancer cases in the Missouri Cancer Registry. Female breast cancer data were linked to Missouri death records and the Social Security Death Index. Unlinked female breast cancer cases were crossmatched to the National Death Index. Female breast cancer cases in subcounty senate districts were geocoded using TIGER/Line shapefiles to identify their district. A database was created and analyzed in SEER*Stat. Senatorial district maps were created using US Census Bureau's cartographic boundary files. The results were loaded with the cartographic data into InstantAtlas software to produce interactive mapping reports. Female breast cancer survival profiles of 5-year cause-specific survival percentages and 95% confidence intervals, displayed in tables and interactive maps, were created for all 34 senatorial districts.

A proper reporting and monitoring system enables adequate calculation of indicators and evidence based decision making. The study aims to examine the appearance of malignancies diagnosed and reported in Kosovo for a three years period: 2012, 2013, and 2014 by its modalities such as by the years of appearance, gender, age, and most frequent types of malignancies. The study is a retrospective cohort research whereas source data we used are reports of malignant diseases from National Cancer Register (NCR) in the Health Information System (HIS) at the National Institute of Public Health of Kosova (NIPHK). In Kosova during years 2012, 2013 and 2014 a total of 7437 cases of malignant diseases were reported; in 2012 were 31%, in 2013 were 24.3%, and during 2014 higher number of cases were reported, 3320 or 44.6%. During the reporting period, the appearance of malignant diseases in both sexes is about equal, with a light predominance of male cases with 50.8% (or 3780 cases), while by age group were represented with the elderly, from ages 50 to 79 years with 5111 cases or 68.8% of total malignancies. The highest number of malignant diseases was reported during year 2014 due to better reporting through HIS and NCR. Malignancies attacked both genders equally, whereas the most common types of malignancies were: melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of the skin, malignant diseases of the respiratory and intrathoracic organs, digestive tract, breast and female genital tract.

This meta-analysis compared their effectiveness and safety. We searched systematically in PubMed, ScienceDirect, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for relevant clinical trials regarding gefitinib versus erlotinib for NSCLC. Antitumor effectiveness (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], objective response rate [ORR] and disease control rate [DCR]) and adverse effects [AEs]) were assessed. Forty studies comprising 9376 participants were included. The results suggested that gefitinib and erlotinib are effective for advanced NSCLC with comparable PFS (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.98-1.11, P?=?.15), OS (95% CI: 0.93-1.19, P?=?.45), ORR (95% CI: 0.99-1.16, P?=?.07), and DCR (95% CI: 0.92-1.03, P?=?.35).

We conducted a phase 3 double-blind trial to evaluate pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma. Patients with completely resected stage III melanoma were randomly assigned (with stratification according to cancer stage and geographic region) to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab (514 patients) or placebo (505 patients) intravenously every 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. Recurrence-free survival in the overall intention-to-treat population and in the subgroup of patients with cancer that was positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) were the primary end points. Safety was also evaluated. At a median follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer recurrence-free survival than placebo in the overall intention-to-treat population (1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs. 61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 0.74; P<0.001) and in the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9] in the pembrolizumab group and 62.6% [95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.69; P<0.001).

In this study, we aimed to determine the phototherapy indications in geriatric patients and to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of phototherapy in this group. This study included 95 patients of 65 years of age and older who were treated in our phototherapy unit between 2006 and 2015. The data for this study were collected retrospectively from patient follow-up forms in the phototherapy unit. Phototherapy was administered to 28 (29.5%) patients for mycosis fungoides, 25 (26.3%) patients foplaque type psoriasis, 12 (12.6%) patients for palmoplantar psoriasis, 12 (12.6%) patients for generalized pruritus, and 18 (19%) for other dermatoses. Of the patients, 64.2% had received a narrowband UVB (NB-UVB), 21.1% oral psoralen UVA (PUVA), and 14.7% local PUVA treatment. A complete response was achieved in 76.9-85.7% of the mycosis fungoides and in 73.71-100% of the psoriasis vulgaris patients treated with NB-UVB and PUVA, respectively. All the patients with generalized pruritus were treated with NB-UVB, and 80% of these patients achieved significant improvement. The erythema rate was found to be 0.43% per session for NB-UVB treatment and 0.46% per session for PUVA treatment as a side effect.

It is a benign entity of uncertain etiology. Most cases of EDS are idiopathic but can be caused by medications, hot beverages, chemical irritants, celiac disease and many skin conditions. Knowing that few case series have described this entity, we decided to review all the cases diagnosed in our center to characterize them. The pathological institutional database of Erasme University Hospital (Brussels, Belgium) was searched for the diagnosis of EDS. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical and endoscopic findings as well as histological features of all cases of EDS (Table 1). During this period of time, 21497 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies have been performed in our institution. From January 2010 to September 2016, we identified 7 cases of EDS diagnosed in our institution in this time period. During the same period, 21497 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed (incidence 0.03%). Endoscopic findings evoked in 2 patients a suspicion of an esophageal tumor; the first one was described as a raised detached lesion of the distal third of the esophagus with suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 1) and the second as a suspected tumor of the proximal third of the esophagus (Fig. 2). For other patients, EDS was misdiagnosed as unspecific esophagitis in 2, reflux or mycotic esophagitis in 2. Only one patient was suspected to have sloughing esophagitis.Histologic features present in all of those cases were characterized by the presence of a sloughing and necrosis of the superficial layer of the esophageal squamous epithelium with negative anti HSV and anti CMV antibodies, negative periodic acid Schiff stain for fungal infections as well as absence of signs of dysplasia or signs of malignancy. In 2 patients, there was a presence of multiple bacterial colonies on the superficial epithelium. Acute inflammation was reported in 4 of the patients with the presence of eosinophils in the superficial epithelium described in 2 of these patients and of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in 2 other patients (Fig. 3).An endoscopic follow up 2 months after PPI treatment performed in 3 patients, 2 of them had an atypical endoscopic presentation with suspicion of a tumor on endoscopic examination showed a complete resolution of the esophageal lesions was observed in these patients.

Although invasive melanoma accounts for only 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths. Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on behavioral counseling for the primary prevention of skin cancer and the 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer with skin self-examination. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether counseling patients about sun protection reduces intermediate outcomes (eg, sunburn or precursor skin lesions) or skin cancer; the link between counseling and behavior change, the link between behavior change and skin cancer incidence, and the harms of counseling or changes in sun protection behavior; and the link between counseling patients to perform skin self-examination and skin cancer outcomes, as well as the harms of skin self-examination. The USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are of moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. The USPSTF recommends counseling young adults, adolescents, children, and parents of young children about minimizing exposure to UV radiation for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types to reduce their risk of skin cancer. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types about minimizing their exposure to UV radiation to reduce risk of skin cancer. Existing evidence indicates that the net benefit of counseling all adults older than 24 years is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the presence of risk factors for skin cancer. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.

Therefore, the structure of cancer deaths according to its primary determinants, such as age, sex and education with the aim of effective implementation of prevention programs in Slovakia was examined. Main source of data on deaths from 1996 to 2014 was provided by National Health Information Centre in Slovakia. However, data were available only from 2011. Standardized mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants was estimated by the method of direct standardization using European standard population. The R project for statistical computing was used for calculation of statistically significant differences among various groups of mortality. The results show that people with primary education die from cancer later than people with higher education. However, major differences related to both sex and age are present in people with university education. A different variety of cancers occur in childhood (neoplasm of brain), adolescents (neoplasm of bone), young adults (neoplasm of brain), or adults (lung cancer and breast cancer). Malignant neoplasm of brain was more prevalent at higher education levels, Malignant neoplasm of bladder and Malignant melanoma of skin were more prevalent at the university level of education.

Patients (N = 117) with MPNs completed questionnaires containing the Distress Thermometer and Problem List and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in a dedicated MPN clinic within an academic medical center. They reported symptoms from any of 22 physical problems on the PPL. Items endorsed by more than 10% of participants were assessed for their associations with distress (Distress Thermometer and Problem List), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety), and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression). The total number of endorsed PPL items per participant was also evaluated. Nine of 22 PPL items (fatigue, sleep, pain, dry skin/pruritus, memory/concentration, feeling swollen, breathing, and sexual) were reported by >10% of participants. In univariate analyses, all PPL items but one were associated with distress and depression, and all but 2 were associated with anxiety. In multivariate analyses, the total number of PPL items was associated with depression only (p < 0.001) when controlling for covariates. Physical symptom burden in MPN patients was clearly associated with psychologic symptoms. Depression was uniquely associated with overall physical symptom burden. As such, the endorsement of multiple PPL items on the Distress Thermometer and Problem List should prompt an evaluation for psychologic symptoms to improve MPN patients' overall morbidity and quality of life.",skin_neoplasms

This could also imply increased effectiveness when treating melanoma. To test whether the BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib together with ionizing radiation more effectively inhibit melanoma cells, primary human melanoma tumor cell lines expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant V600E BRAF were analyzed by cell survival, cell death, and cell-cycle testing. All melanoma cell lines examined were radioresistant in these assays. BRAF inhibitor treatment alone suppressed cell survival more effectively than radiation in all the mutant V600E BRAF cell lines, and vemurafenib, but not dabrafenib, also inhibited cell survival in the WT BRAF cell lines at clinically relevant concentrations. However, when cells were treated with BRAF inhibitor followed by radiation, there was no increased effect on the suppression of cell survival. Vemurafenib induced more necrosis than radiation in most melanoma cell lines, irrespective of BRAF status, but this effect was not additive with the combination treatment. BRAF inhibitors and radiation had variable, but independent effects on the induction of cell-cycle arrest.

A 12-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with multiple hemangiomas for 12 years. The patient often displayed melena; she recently received transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells once every 2 weeks. Multiple fist-sized hemangiomas were piled up on both sides and back of the neck, and were also noted on the arms, legs, chest, back, and on the tip of the tongue. The laboratory findings demonstrated severe anemia. Blood sample sequencing detected a heterozygous de novo mutation c.2545C > Tin the TEK gene. Based on these findings, final diagnosis of Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) was made. After the diagnosis, low-dose sirolimus was orally administered. The patient's hemoglobin was increased after treatment with sirolimus for 1 month. Since the initial treatment with sirolimus, she had not received any blood transfusions. The skin and mucosal hemangioma decreased significantly, and new digestive tract hemorrhage, muscle hematoma, or adverse drug reactions were not observed. we report a case of a mutation in exon 15 of the TEK gene leading to BRBN. It was successfully treated with a small dose of sirolimus as an alternative to blood transfusion in order to save the of BRBN patient's life.",skin_neoplasms
29461632,"Higher all-cause mortality in asthmatics has been shown previously. Polysensitization is associated with higher morbidity among asthmatic children, and allergic rhinitis and/or allergic conjunctivitis (AR/AC) are associated with higher morbidity in adult asthmatics. Little is known about the effect of AR/AC and other factors on mortality among adult asthmatics. The aim was to study mortality and its risk factors in adults with and without asthma. We randomly selected 1648 asthmatics with age over 30 years from national registers and matched the asthma sample with one or two controls. Baseline information was obtained by a questionnaire in 1997, and the study population was linked with the death certificate information of Statistics Finland from 1997 to 2013. Overall and cause-specific survival between the groups was compared in several adjusted models. During a mean follow-up period of 15.6 years, 221 deaths among 1052 asthma patients and 335 deaths among 1889 nonasthmatics were observed. Cardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death in both groups. Asthma was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.49, P = .011) as well as mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 12.0, 4.18-34.2, P < .001) and malignant neoplasms of respiratory organs (HR 2.33, 1.25-4.42, P = .008). Among asthmatics, smoking was associated with increased all-cause mortality, and self-reported AR/AC was associated with decreased mortality. Among nonasthmatics, smoking, and obesity were associated with increased all-cause mortality, whereas female gender showed an association with a decreased risk. Increased mortality among adult asthmatics was largely explained by the development of COPD, malignant respiratory tract neoplasms, and cardiovascular diseases. Smoking cessation is important for reduction in total mortality in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic adults. AR/AC was associated with decreased mortality only in asthmatics. Thus, studies in other populations of larger size are needed to explore further the nature of this association.",skin_neoplasms

This is a secondary analysis of the comparator arm (sorafenib arm) of the NCT00699374 study which is a phase III multicenter study conducted between 2008 and 2010. The univariate probability of overall and progression-free survival was assessed among different patient subsets through Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall and progression-free survival was then conducted through Cox regression analysis.

We report a 67-year-oldman with a history of polycythemia vera who was referred for management of progressively worsening dorsal hand lesions. The patient presented withhyperpigmentation, ichthyosis, plantar keratoderma, dermatomyositis-like eruptions, two squamous cell carcinomas, and actinic keratoses. The adversereactions observed were acknowledged to be related to chronic hydroxyurea use. The patient underwent Mohs excision of the squamous cell carcinomas and thehydroxyurea was promptly discontinued; subsequent cutaneous improvement of the dermatomyositislike lesions ensued. Another clinically suspicious aggressive squamous cell carcinoma was suspected and the patient was referred to the plastic surgery department for complete excision because of the size of the lesion. The patient remains on periodic dermatology follow up. We report a case that exemplifies the cutaneous adverse effects of chronic hydroxyurea therapy.

29436004,"A number of homeobox transcriptional factors are utilised as organ-specific markers in the histopathological diagnosis of neoplasms. We have screened a homeobox gene that is expressed specifically in normal sweat gland cells and is useful for the histopathological diagnosis of sweat gland neoplasms. By screening an open database resource of The Human Protein Atlas, 37 genes among the 235 homeobox transcriptional factors were found to be expressed specifically in the skin. Among those 37 genes, the engrailed homeobox 1 (En1) was expressed in normal eccrine glands but not in the epidermal keratinocytes. Expression of En1 was found throughout the eccrine glands, but not in the apocrine secretory coils, sebaceous glands or hair follicles. Expression of En1 was examined immunohistochemically in 111 cases of cutaneous epithelial neoplasms. All nine cases of poroma, seven cases of spiradenoma and six cases of syringoma, which are considered to differentiate towards eccrine glands, showed positive nuclear staining in most of the tumour cells. Sebaceous gland and hair follicle tumours were immunonegative. En1 was expressed focally in the epidermal neoplasms of seborrheic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. Engrailed homeobox 1 was expressed specifically in normal eccrine glands and was expressed in most of the tumour cells of sweat gland neoplasms with eccrine gland differentiation. En1 was expressed focally in epidermal neoplasms; however, it was absent in sebaceous or hair follicle neoplasms. These findings will help in the histopathological diagnosis as well as understanding of the histogenesis of sweat gland neoplasms.",skin_neoplasms

We retrieved 14 cases with PCACC (each from a different patient) from the files of the authors. Cases were dated from 1994 to 2014. We also evaluated 6 cases of cutaneous breast cancer metastasis RESULTS: No PCACCs expressed GATA3. Breast cancer metastases expressed GATA3 in 100% of our studied cases. Even though GATA3 expression has been reported in many benign and malignant adnexal tumors (mostly of sebaceous, follicular, and apocrine differentiation), as well as in many other neoplasms, GATA3 staining to differentiate PCACC from skin breast cancer metastasis has a high negative predictive value. A positive GATA3 staining in this context should permit one to rule out PCACC with a high level of confidence.",skin_neoplasms

Retrospective, descriptive medical record review. A tertiary care centre. We did a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and primary squamous cell carcinoma between 2003-2016. Prevalence and pattern of BCC and SCC with respect to age, sex, and anatomic location. Of 593 cases reviewed, 279 had NMSC. Most (95%) were diagnosed with BCC or SCC or both in a few cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 59 (19.5) years. Sixty-two percent of the patients were males. However, 24.3% (n=68) of skin cancers occurred in patients younger than 50 years. The frequency of BCC and SCC was 50.2% and 44.8%, respectively. The head and neck was the most common location (79.6%). In patients younger than 50 years, xeroderma pigmentosum and previously treated solid malignancies were the major factors. BCC and SCC are uncommon but not rare.

Randomised controlled trials of adults with histologically proven metastatic cutaneous melanoma in which systemic anti-cancer therapy was compared with placebo or supportive care. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers. Data extraction forms were used for studies which appeared to meet the selection criteria and, where appropriate, full text articles were retrieved and reviewed independently. No randomised controlled trials were found comparing a systemic therapy with placebo or best supportive care in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. There is no evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials to show superiority of systemic therapy over best supportive care / placebo in the treatment of malignant cutaneous melanoma.Given that patients with metastatic melanoma frequently receive systemic therapy, it is our pragmatic view that a future systematic review could compare any systemic treatment, or combination of treatments, to single agent dacarbazine.",skin_neoplasms

In the present study anticancer activity of AO-(2) has been investigated on A431 human epidermoid cancer and precancerous HaCaT cells. Cell viability was used to detect cytotoxic activity. Mechanism of cell death induced by AO-(2) treatments was studied using Annexin V-FITC/PI binding, cell cycle analysis, measurement of MMP and ROS generation by flow cytometry. Expression of apoptosis related proteins was investigated by western blot. AO-(2) inhibited the growth and colony formation ability of A431 and HaCaT cells in concentration dependent manner. It induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis through intracellular ROS accumulation. Inhibition of intracellular ROS by ascorbic acid and N-acetyl cysteine treatment completely blocked apoptotic effect. N-acetyl cysteine treatment significantly reversed G0/G1 arrest induced by AO-(2). AO-(2) treatment caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (¥Ä¥×m), increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, cytochrome c release, activation of caspases (cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9) and PARP cleavage.

In this prospective study, we investigated direct electron field, in terms of optimal coverage of tumour bed volume following localization using ultrasound and surgical clips. First, for all 24 patients, a breast sonographer drew perimeter of tumour bed on the breast skin. Then an electron boost field was outlined on the demarcated territory, and a lead wire marker compatible with CT scan was placed on the field borders by a 2cm margin. After CT scan simulation, all patients underwent adjuvant whole breast irradiation with 3D-conformal radiotherapy to 50Gy in 25 fractions. Then for boost radiotherapy, lead wire in CT images was countoured as electron boost field. Also, the tumour bed was contoured based on surgical clips (true clinical target volume and true planning target volume). Electron treatment planning was done for electron boost field. Finally isodose coverages for true planning target volume investigated. On average, 16.68% of clips planning target volume (true planning target volume; range: 0.00 to 95%) received 90% oor more of the prescribed dose when the electron treatment plan was made. Isodose curves does not provide adequate coverage on the tumour bed (clips planning target volume) when electron boost treatment planning was generated for electron boost field (en face electron field). In fact, a part of target (planning target volume-c) is missed and more doses is absorbed in normal tissue.

We conducted a systematic review for randomized trials in PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE using the terms (""cetuximab"" or ""panitumumab"") AND (""colorectal cancer"" OR ""colorectal carcinoma""). Data of adverse events were aggregated to obtain pooled incidence rates of prespecified adverse events. Incidence of skin toxicities was the primary outcome. A ¥ö2 test was used for comparisons of proportions and an odds ratio (OR) was calculated for comparison. A total of 38 studies were included for analysis. Cetuximab was associated with fewer G3-4 skin toxicities (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.53-0.62; p < 0.001), slightly more frequent G3-4 acne-like rash (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; p = 0.04), and paronychia (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.1-1.7), but fewer cases of skin fissures (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93; p = 0.02) and pruritus (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.58; p < 0.001) than PANI.

As patients with this condition have been excluded from most clinical trials, data on the use of anti-programmed death 1 therapy for these patients are limited. The patient was a 62-year-old man with a 10-year history of melanotic nevus in his right forearm. He was admitted to another hospital in August 2015 due to the growth of the melanotic nevus over 1 year and complaint of a mass in the right mid-axillary area. The patient had no relevant medical, surgical, or family history. The biopsy of his right axillary lymph node showed malignant melanoma. He was subsequently treated with adjuvant high-dose interferon after dacarbazine. Numerous metastatic lesions were found in his lung, abdomen, pelvic cavity, and brain after five months later, and then Pembrolizumab was used for six cycles (2?mg/kg every 3 weeks). He experienced immunorelated adverse events and we gave him cortisol to treat immunorelated disease until pneumonia was found. We observed a delayed effect after three cycles of Pembrolizumab, the intracranial lesion presented clear margins and localization, while the other lesions became much smaller. A mixed response was observed after four cycles, with still stable extracranial metastases but growing a new lesion in brain. After two additional cycles of Pembrolizumab, the treatment was stopped due to the patient's inability to pay for it and a decline in his performance status. He then received palliative treatment at a local hospital and died for severe pulmonary infection, with an overall survival time of 7 months from metastasis. In the case reported here, a delayed and mixed response was observed after Pembrolizumab was used. Because of causing severe pulmonary infection, the use of steroids should be considered carefully when treating immunorelated adverse events. It seemed that the Pembrolizumab has a positive effect on melanoma brain metastases especially combined with other treatments. However, there are still some challenges including patient selection, predictors of response, drug tolerance, optimizing combination strategies and control of adverse effects.

Although pulmonary complications are not common, vEDS cases complicated by pneumothorax, hemothorax, or intrapulmonary hematoma have been reported. When a patient initially presents only with pulmonary complications, it is not easy for clinicians to suspect vEDS. We report a case of an 18-year-old high school student, with a past history of cryptorchidism, presenting with recurrent pneumothorax. Routine laboratory findings were unremarkable. Chest high resolution computed tomographic scan showed age-unmatched hyperinflation of both lungs, atypical cystic changes and multifocal ground glass opacities scattered in both lower lobes. His slender body shape, hyperflexible joints, and hyperextensible skin provided clue to suspicion of a possible connective tissue disorder. The histological examination of the lung lesions showed excessive capillary proliferation in the pulmonary interstitium and pleura allowing the diagnosis of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH)-like foci. Genetic study revealed COL3A1 gene splicing site mutation confirming his diagnosis as vEDS. Although his diagnosis vEDS is notorious for fatal vascular complication, there was no evidence of such complication at presentation. Fortunately, he has been followed up for 10 months without pulmonary or vascular complications. To the best of our knowledge, both cryptorchidism and PCH-like foci have never been reported yet as complications of vEDS, suggesting our case might be a new variant of this condition.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of different individual and environmental factors including exposed body surface area (BSA), UVB dose and vitamin D status, on serum 25(OH)D concentration. In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, and Meta-analysis of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted (MEDLINE; 01/1960-07/2016) investigating the impact of these factors on vitamin D status after artificial UV exposure as main outcome measure. Summary mean differences [and 95% confidence interval (CI)] were derived from random-effects meta-analysis to account for possible heterogeneity across studies. Meta-regression was conducted to account for impact of UVB dose, baseline 25(OH)D level and BSA. We identified 15 studies, with an estimated mean 25(OH)D rise per standard erythema dose (SED) of 0.19 nmol/l (95% CI 0.11-0.26 nmol/l). Results from meta-regression suggest a significant impact of UV dose and baseline 25(OH)D concentration on serum 25(OH)D level (p<0.01). Single UVB doses between 0.75 and 3 SED resulted in the highest rise of serum 25(OH)D per dose unit. BSA exposed had a smaller, non-proportional, not significant impact. Partial BSA exposure resulted in relatively higher rise compared to whole-body exposure (e.g. exposure of face and hands caused an 8-fold higher rise of serum 25(OH)D concentration/SED/1% BSA compared to whole-body exposure). Our findings support previous reports, estimating that the half-life of serum 25(OH)D varies depending on different factors. Our results indicate that partial BSA exposure (e.g. 10%) with moderate UV doses (e.g. 1 SED) is effective in generating or maintaining a healthy vitamin D status.

E2F3 affects the melanoma cell glucose metabolism and growth. We also demonstrated that lncRNA H19 may function as the sponge of miR-106a-5p to up-regulate E2F3 expression, and consequently promote the glucose metabolism and growth of melanoma.

Sebaceous neoplasms (SNs) may occur before other malignancies, and may lead to the diagnosis, which allows testing of other family members, cancer surveillance, risk-reducing surgery or prevention therapies. To evaluate the efficacy of universal immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening of SNs in a service setting. Patients with SNs were ascertained by a regional clinical pathology service over a 3-year period. Results of tumour IHC, clinical genetics notes and germline genetic testing were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 62 patients presented with 71 SNs; 9 (15%) of these patients had previously diagnosed MTS. Tumour IHC was performed for 50 of the 53 remaining patients (94%); 26 (52%) had loss of staining of one or more mismatch repair proteins. Fifteen patients were referred to the Clinical Genetics department, and 10 patients underwent germline genetic testing. Two had a new diagnosis of MTS confirmed, with heterozygous pathogenic mutations detected in the MSH2 and PMS2 genes (diagnostic yield 20%). The PMS2 mutation was identified in a 57-year-old woman with a sebaceous adenoma and history of endometrial cancer; to our knowledge, this is the first time a PMS2 mutation has been reported in MTS. Universal IHC screening of SNs is an effective method to identify cases for further genetic evaluation. Rates of referral to clinical genetics were only moderate (58%). Increased awareness of MTS could help improve the rate of onward referral.",skin_neoplasms

This study aimed to investigate the number of beachgoers, the duration of sun exposure, and clothing worn during the day on a beach in Copenhagen. Observational, descriptive study. On 11 beach days in 2014 and 2015, beachgoers were counted every hour from 8:00 to 20:00. It was noted if they wore clothes or swimwear. To estimate the duration of sun exposure, it was noted how long cars were parked by the beach. Of the counted beachgoers 46% were present from noon to 15:00. The number of beachgoers peaked at 15:00 on weekend days (Saturdays and Sunday) and at 16:00 on working days (Monday to Friday). Both on weekend days and working days, the percentage of beachgoers wearing clothes was lowest at 13:00 when about 90% wore only swimwear. Cars were parked for 117?min on average. Around noon, the mean time expanded to 142?min. We assume this to reflect the duration of a beach visit. The results indicate a weak tendency to limit time in the sun and to seek shade when the ultraviolet radiation is strongest in the midday sun. Hopefully information about actual sun behaviour can be used to adjust campaigns.",skin_neoplasms

The optimal management is dubious and most studies are from Caucasian populations. We aimed to examine the treatment and outcome of this disease in Chinese patients. Data of patients with histopathologically verified cutaneous angiosarcoma of the head and neck during December 1997 to September 2016 were retrieved from our hospital cancer registry. The demographic data, clinicopathological information, modality of treatment, and outcomes were reviewed. During the study period, 17 Chinese patients were treated. Their median age was 81 years. The tumours were present in the scalp only (n=11), face only (n=4), or both scalp and face (n=2). Only two patients had distant metastases. The modalities of treatment were surgery (n=6), surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (n=1), palliative radiotherapy (n=5), or palliative chemotherapy (n=3). The remaining two patients refused any treatment initially. Of the seven patients treated surgically, there were four local and two regional recurrences. The median time to relapse was 7.5 months. Overall, 16 patients had died; causes of death were disease-related in 12 whereas four other patients died of inter-current illnesses. One patient was still living with the disease. The median overall survival was 11.1 months and the longest overall survival was 42 months. The outcome of angiosarcoma in our series is poor.

Although thiopurine therapy in organ transplant recipients is known to increase nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), dermatologic literature yields less data regarding NMSC risk of thiopurine use in IBD. The aim of this study was to systematically review current literature on NMSC risk in patients with IBD using thiopurine therapy. Systematic review of PubMed was performed with keywords ""inflammatory bowel disease,"" ""ulcerative colitis,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""thiopurine,"" ""azathioprine,"" ""6-mercaptopurine,"" ""skin cancer,"" ""non-melanoma,"" ""squamous cell carcinoma,"" and ""basal cell carcinoma.""

Heterogeneity of study designs limited direct comparisons of thiopurine exposure and NMSC risk. Patients with IBD using thiopurines seem to have a moderately increased risk of NMSC that is proportional to therapy duration. Risk of NMSC seems to decrease or return to baseline after discontinuing therapy, although additional data are needed to support this trend. Younger patients with IBD using thiopurines seem to be at greater risk of NMSC.

29277358,"Lymphoedema is a dreadful complication following breast cancer therapy. According to the International Society of Lymphology, the consensus treatment for breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is the decongestive lymphatic therapy. This is a two-phase treatment and combines different treatment modalities including skin care, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression therapy and exercise. However, the additional effect of MLD is debated since pooled data only demonstrated a limited non-significant additional value. A possible explanation is that in previous studies MLD has been applied blind, without knowledge of patient-specific lymphatic routes of transport. In addition, the MLD hand manoeuvres used by the therapists in previous studies, possibly did not optimally stimulate lymphatic transport. Recently, near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been introduced to visualise the superficial lymphatic network which allows MLD at the most needed location. The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of the fluoroscopy-guided MLD, additional to the other parts of the decongestive lymphatic therapy and compared to the traditional or a placebo MLD, in the treatment of BCRL. A three-arm double-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted in different university hospitals in Belgium. Based on a sample size calculation, 201 participants with chronic BCRL stage 1 or 2 of the arm or hand, with at least 5% difference between both sides (corrected for hand dominance) need to be recruited. All participants receive the standard treatment: skin care, compression therapy and exercises. The intervention group additionally receives fluoroscopy-guided MLD.

Risk groups were established according to the 2005 World Health Organization-EORTC classification for cutaneous lymphomas. Data of patients admitted between January 2008 and December 2012 were analyzed. 74 patients were included. Mean age was 49.5 years. In order of frequency, diagnoses were: mycosis fungoides (40.5%), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (22.95%), adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (18.9%), CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (6.8%), hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (5.4%), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (4.1%) and S?zary syndrome (1.4%). Predominant clinical patterns were observed across different entities. Mycosis fungoides appeared mainly as plaques (93%). Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia presentation was polymorphic. All patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma presented with facial edema. All cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma appeared as ulcerated nodules/tumors. Disseminated cutaneous involvement was found in 71.6% cases. Forty-six percent of patients were alive at 5 years. Five-year overall survival was 76.4% and 19.2%, for indolent and high-risk lymphomas, respectively (p<0.05). High risk group (HR: 4.6 [2.08-10.18]) and increased DHL level (HR: 3.2 [1.57-6.46]) emerged as prognostic factors for survival. Small series. Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides or CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders are aggressive entities with a poor prognosis.",skin_neoplasms
29166345,"Staged subpectoral expander-implant breast reconstruction is widely performed. Disruption of the pectoralis major origin and the frequent occurrence of animation deformity and functional discomfort associated with subpectoral reconstruction remain ongoing concerns. Prepectoral single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction resolves many of these issues. In this study, the authors explored the rationale for prepectoral single-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with anterior AlloDerm coverage as an alternative to the staged approach. Seventy-three breasts in 50 patients were reconstructed using a single-stage direct-to-implant prepectoral approach with total anterior AlloDerm coverage during a 24-month period. The decision to proceed with single-stage reconstruction was predicated upon the adequacy of mastectomy skin flap blood flow based on indocyanine green fluorescence perfusion assessment. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 32 months. Ninety-seven percent of patients achieved complete healing within 8 weeks. There were 2 implant losses (2.7%) due to infection. Major seroma rate requiring repeated aspiration and drain insertion was 1.2%. There were no full-thickness skin losses. Capsular contracture was 0% in nonradiated patients. There were no cases of animation deformity. The authors were unable to establish significant correlation between complications and any of the usually stated risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and large mastectomy weights, presumably due to the rigorous application of intraoperative skin perfusion assessment. Single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction using a prepectoral approach appears to be a safe and effective means of breast reconstruction in many patients, assuming adequate skin perfusion is present.",skin_neoplasms
29158674,"Cell-mediated delivery of nanoparticles is emerging as a new method of cancer diagnostics and treatment. Due to their inherent regenerative properties, adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are naturally attracted to wounds and sites of inflammation, as well as tumors. Such characteristics enable MSCs to be used in cellular hitchhiking of nanoparticles. In this study, MSCs extracted from the skin connective tissue were investigated as transporters of semiconductor nanocrystals quantum dots (QDs). Cytotoxicity of carboxylated CdSe/ZnS QDs was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase cell viability assay. Quantitative uptake of QDs was determined by flow cytometry; their intracellular localization was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In vitro tumor-tropic migration of skin-derived MSCs was verified by Transwell migration assay. For in vivo migration studies of QD-loaded MSCs, human breast tumor-bearing immunodeficient mice were used. QDs were found to be nontoxic to MSCs in concentrations no more than 16 nM. The uptake studies showed a rapid QD endocytosis followed by saturating effects after 6 h of incubation and intracellular localization in the perinuclear region. In vitro migration of MSCs toward MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and their conditioned medium was up to nine times greater than the migration toward noncancerous breast epithelial cells MCF-10A. In vivo, systemically administered QD-labeled MSCs were mainly located in the tumor and metastatic tissues, evading most healthy organs with the exception being blood clearance organs (spleen, kidneys, liver). Skin-derived MSCs demonstrate applicability in cell-mediated delivery of nanoparticles. The findings presented in this study promise further development of a cell therapy and nanotechnology-based tool for early cancer diagnostics and therapy.",skin_neoplasms

Paired blood and tumour DNA samples from patients with anti-TIF1¥ã-positive CAM and from controls were analysed by whole-exome sequencing for the presence of somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in their TIF1 genes. The genesis and maintenance of the autoimmune process were investigated immunohistochemically by studying TIF1¥ã expression in the different tissues involved in CAM (skin, muscle and tumour) based on the immunohistochemical H-score. From seven patients with anti-TIF1¥ã-positive CAM, we detected one somatic mutation and five cases of LOH in one or more of the four TIF1 genes compared with just one case of LOH in tumours from TIF1¥ã-negative myositis patients (86% vs 17%; P =",skin_neoplasms
29145324,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine-derived cutaneous cancer. Ectopic or single metastatic MCC located in thorax is extremely rare; meanwhile, its definite management has not been elucidated yet. A 64-year-old female patient with a giant mass located in her left thorax was presented for stuffy pain of left chest for 6 months and fever for half a month. She underwent radical resection of vulvar MCC 10 years ago. Computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the intrathoracic mass revealed a diagnosis of MCC, without synchronous urogenital lesions on pelvic CT images. This bulky tumor was completely resected via thoracotomy, along with the adjacent pulmonary lobe, pericardium, pleura, and diaphragm. The patient survived without local-regional recurrence or distant metastasis during the follow-up of 1 year up to now. Ectopic or single metastatic MCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intrathoracic tumors, especially in patients with a history of MCC. Besides, a timely surgery combined with chemotherapy is effective for this disease.",skin_neoplasms
29144206,"The AP-1 transcription factor complex is a key player in regulating inflammatory processes, cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell transformation. The aim of the present study is to investigate C-Jun (one of AP-1complex) expression and its proliferative role in skin samples of lichen planus, psoriasis as common inflammatory skin diseases and squamous cell carcinoma using immunohistochemical method. The present study was carried out on skin biopsies of 15 psoriatic patients, 15 lichen planus patients, 15 SCC, and 15 normal skin biopsies. Nuclear expression of C-Jun was detected in basal and few suprabasal layers of epidermis of normal skin. C-Jun was expressed in the whole epidermal layers of both psoriasis (14/15) and lichen planus (15/15) in addition to its expression in lymphocytic infiltrate in the latter in about half of cases (8/15). C-Jun was also expressed in 93.3% (14/15) of SCC in a percentage lower than that of psoriasis, lichen planus, and normal skin. The percentage of C-Jun expression in SCC was significantly associated with an early stage (p?=?0.000), free surgical margins (p?=?0.022), and small tumour size (p?=?0.003). The marked reduction of C-Jun in SCC in comparison to normal skin and inflammatory skin dermatoses may refer to its tumour suppressor activity. C-Jun expression in SCC carries favourable prognosis. Absence of significant association between C-Jun and Ki-67 either in SCC or inflammatory skin diseases indicates that it does not affect proliferative capacity of cells.",skin_neoplasms

SWSs have been described at higher frequencies in melanomas than in benign nevi. We assessed the diagnostic value of different patterns of SWSs and their histologic correlate in melanocytic lesions. Polarized dermoscopic images of 1507 histopathologically diagnosed melanocytic neoplasms were analyzed for presence and pattern of SWSs. Histology was also reviewed for correlation. Among 1507 melanocytic neoplasms, SWSs were observed in 31 of 144 melanomas (22%) and 22 of 1363 benign neoplasms (1.6%) (P?<?.001). The sensitivity and specificity of SWSs for melanoma were 22% and 98%, respectively. Diffuse SWSs exhibited the greatest diagnostic value for melanoma, with sensitivity of 11.8% and specificity of 99.5%. Focal central and peripheral SWSs were comparable in diagnostic significance. The presence of SWSs was highly uncommon in dysplastic nevi, whereas in certain benign subgroups of nevi such as Spitz nevi and atypical genital special site nevi, SWSs were not uncommon. Diffuse SWSs correlated with greater breadth of deep fibroplasia than focal SWSs (P?=?.009), and SWSs correlated with greater Breslow depth among melanomas (P?=?.007). This study was retrospective. Polarized dermoscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool in the identification of SWSs, a feature that is highly specific for melanoma.",skin_neoplasms
29133634,"Overexpression of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins have been demonstrated in a variety and of solid tumors including melanomas and nonmelanomas skin cancers. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an inhibitor of apoptosis which prevents apoptosis by inhibiting caspases 9, 7, and 3. The prognostic value of XIAP in sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) remains unexplored. The immunohistochemical expression of XIAP was evaluated in 29 SGC cases. The cytoplasmic overexpression of XIAP was detected in 62% SGC cases. XIAP expression was found to be significantly associated with advanced age, large tumor size, and with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0.0174). XIAP expression and advance tumor Grade III emerged as significant risk factors on univariate analysis. On stepwise multivariate analysis, both increased cytoplasmic XIAP expression and high tumor grade were found to be significantly associated with recurrence. Patients with low XIAP immunoexpression had a longer disease-specific survival than those with high expression in the 5-year follow-up. The present study demonstrates at the immunohistochemical level that XIAP is overexpressed in SGC and that high expression could be of biological significance in the development of eyelid SGC. Our finding suggests that up-regulation of XIAP may aggravate tumor metastasis in SGC.",skin_neoplasms

This study assessed where children with cancer in the Netherlands were treated since 2004. All patients aged under 18 diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2013 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and linked with the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) database. Associations between patient and tumour characteristics and site of care were tested statistically with logistic regression analyses. This population-based study of 6021 children diagnosed with cancer showed that 82% of them were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. Ninety-four percent of the patients under 10?years of age, 85% of the patients aged 10-14 and 48% of the patients aged 15-17 were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. All International Classification of Childhood Cancers (ICCC), 3rd edition, ICCC-3 categories, except embryonal tumours, were associated with a higher risk of treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre compared to leukaemia. Multivariable analyses by ICCC-3 category revealed that specific tumour types such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), embryonal carcinomas, bone tumours other type than osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomas, thyroid carcinomas, melanomas and skin carcinomas as well as lower-staged tumours were associated with treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre. The site of childhood cancer care in the Netherlands depends on the age of the cancer patient, type of tumour and stage at diagnosis. Collaboration between paediatric oncology centre(s), other academic units is needed to ensure most up-to-date paediatric cancer care for childhood cancer patients at the short and long term.",skin_neoplasms
29107432,"Healing after abdomino-perineal resection is often difficult, especially in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. Vaginal reconstruction is also an important issue for the women who undergo this surgery. We describe and analyze here our series of perineal reconstructions with modified Taylor flaps. Between 2010 and 2016, 68 patients (52 women, 16 men) with cancer of the anal canal (53), adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (9), or other malignant neoplasms of the perineum underwent reconstruction with a rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) flap with an inferior pedicle and an oblique skin paddle. This review of records showed that all patients healed, with a median of 30 days. The reoperation rate was 11.7% including 1 for eventration. The principal causes for delayed healing were scar dehiscence, abscess, and partial necrosis. No flap required removal, however. The mean duration of hospitalization was 23.7 days. Modified Taylor flaps substantially improved the reconstruction of defects resulting from abdomino-perineal resection. They enabled complete and rapid healing with low comorbidity.",skin_neoplasms
29106060,"To evaluate the attitudes of patients with different cancers towards research biopsies outside a clinical trial. Patients with metastatic cancer completed a questionnaire that assessed patients' willingness to consider research biopsies. Research biopsies were divided into two groups: biopsies performed as stand-alone procedures (research purposes only biopsy, RPOB) or performed during a clinically indicated biopsy (additional pass biopsy, APB). Factors analyzed included biopsy timing, biopsy site, sociodemographic information and information about prior trial participation. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using random-effects logistic regression. One hundred and sixty-five patients with cancer (40 melanoma, 37 colorectal, 32 breast, 30 lung, 26 prostate) completed the questionnaire. Patients with melanoma demonstrated the greatest willingness to consider a research biopsy compared to patients with other cancer types (P?<?0.05). Patients' ethnicity, time since previous biopsies, time since metastatic diagnosis, and previous trial enrolment were all statistically significant for willingness to consider a research biopsy on univariate analysis. When adjusting for statistically significant variables on univariate analysis, the odds of patients considering APBs were 14.6 times greater than RPOBs (P?<?0.0001). Patients were also more willing to consider having blood or skin taken for research purposes (P?<?0.0001) compared to liver and bone biopsies. Patients with cancer show a greater willingness to consider APBs compared to RPOBs, and biopsies performed at less invasive body sites. There are differences in the attitudes of patients with different cancers towards research biopsies. Further research addressing motivations and barriers to research biopsies should be considered to increase the availability of this important resource.",skin_neoplasms
29100192,"Melanomas are initially excised in primary care, and rates vary internationally. Until now, there has been no strong evidence one way or the other that excising melanomas in primary care is safe or unsafe. European guidelines make no recommendations, and the United Kingdom (UK) melanoma guidelines require all suspicious skin lesions to be initially treated in secondary care based on an expert consensus, which lacks supporting evidence, that primary care excision represents substandard care. Despite this, studies have found that up to 20% of melanomas in the UK are excised by general practitioners (GPs). Patients receiving primary care melanoma excision may fear that their care is substandard and their long-term survival threatened, neither of which may be justified. Scottish cancer registry data from 9367 people diagnosed with melanoma in Scotland between 2005 and 2013 were linked to pathology records, hospital data and death records. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusting for key confounders, explored the association between morbidity and mortality and setting of primary melanoma excision (primary versus secondary care). A pooled estimate of the relative hazard of death of having a melanoma excised in primary versus secondary care including 7116 patients from a similar Irish study was also performed. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of death from melanoma for those having primary care excision was 0.82 (0.61-1.10). Those receiving primary care excision had a median (IQR) of 8 (3-14) out-patient attendances compared to 10 (4-17) for the secondary care group with an adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of 0.98 (0.96-1.01). Both groups had a median of 1 (0-2) hospital admissions with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.05 (0.98-1.13). In the meta-analysis, with primary care as the reference, the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI) was 1.26 (1.07-1.50) indicating a significantly higher all-cause mortality among those with excision in secondary care. The results of the Scottish and pooled analyses suggest that those receiving an initial excision for melanoma in primary care do not have poorer survival or increased morbidity compared to those being initially treated in secondary care. A randomised controlled trial to inform a greater role for GPs in the initial excision of melanoma is justified in the light of these results.",skin_neoplasms

A retrospective analysis was performed in pediatric patients who underwent tissue expansion for giant congenital melanocytic nevi. We tested four factors that may influence the expansion rate: The number of surgeries, expander location, expander size, and sex.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the methylation status of the CGI located in the 5' region of G0S2 (hereinafter called 5' G0S2 CGI) in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (RT-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing were performed to evaluate the methylation statuses of cutaneous SCC and normal epithelial cell samples. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed to evaluate RNA expression levels. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect protein expression. G0S2 was suppressed in the five SCC cell lines with 5' G0S2 CGI methylation levels of nearly 100.0% and was expressed in the two normal cultured keratinocytes with methylation levels of almost 0.0%. G0S2 was re-expressed in SCC cell lines treated with a demethylating agent. The in vivo methylation levels of 5' G0S2 CGI as determined by RT-MSP varied widely (0.0% to 77.7%) in 17 cutaneous SCC samples and narrowly (0.1% to 7.3%) in 6 normal epidermis samples. Nine cutaneous SCC samples exhibited higher methylation levels than the highest methylation level (7.3%) of the 6 normal epidermis samples. Bisulfite sequencing showed dense methylated CpG sites within 5' G0S2 CGI in these highly methylated cutaneous SCC samples. The methylation levels of the cutaneous SCC samples did not correlate with any clinical parameters investigated or with histopathological grading.

Of these, 11 NZ patients followed a management protocol; 11 NZ patients and 11 Chinese patients followed a prophylactic protocol. An area of the neck receiving a homogenous radiation dose of > 35 Gy was divided into two equal halves; one half was randomized to Film and the other to either Sorbolene cream (NZ) or Biafine cream (China). Skin reaction severity was measured by Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale and expanded Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity criteria. Skin dose was measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters or gafchromic film. Film decreased overall skin reaction severity (combined Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale score) by 29% and moist desquamation rates by 37% in the Chinese cohort and by 27 and 28%, respectively in the NZ cohort. Mepitel Film did not affect head movements but did not adhere well to the skin, particularly in males with heavy beard stubble, and caused itchiness, particularly in Chinese patients.

To review the literature on atypical melanocytic proliferations and detail synonymous terms, epidemiology, diagnostic work-up, histopathology, treatment, and prognosis. Databases from PubMed and Web of Science were searched for articles related to atypical melanocytic proliferations. Intraepidermal melanocytic proliferations with features worrisome for possible melanoma in situ (MIS) are generally excised as for MIS. Reported rates of upstaging of such cases to invasive melanoma on review of the excision are very low. Because invasion, lymph node spread, and metastasis can occur in atypical melanocytic lesions with a thick intradermal component, these are often treated as for malignant melanoma. Because the diagnosis dictates treatment, it is incumbent to establish a diagnosis as definitive as possible, obtaining second or third opinions and using ancillary studies when appropriate. When the diagnosis remains uncertain, it is difficult to provide guidelines for treatment.

The AJCC7 pN3 category was associated with reduced disease specific survival (DSS HR 5.49; 95% CI: 1.83-16.53; P?=?0.002) and overall survival (OS HR 3.42; 95% CI: 1.54-7.58; P?=?0.002) as compared with pN1. However, no difference was observed between pN1, pN2, and pN3 categories as defined by the AJCC8. Also, when comparing Stages III and IV as defined by AJCC8, there was no difference in DSS (HR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.34-1.67; P?=?0.478) or OS (HR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.51-1.51; P?=?0.648). The AJCC8 performed poorly as a prognostic indicator for patients with metastatic HNcSCC in this cohort. HNcSCC would benefit from a staging system that accounts for its unique biologic characteristics distinct from mucosal SCC.",skin_neoplasms

Two distinct clinical forms have been described as the following phenotypes: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B) syndromes. The common and necessary nexus that defines these 2 phenotypes is the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The familial MTC type of MEN 2 syndrome was included within the spectrum of MEN 2A syndrome. Cutaneous manifestations of MEN 2A syndrome include macular amyloidosis, whereas MEN 2B syndrome is traditionally linked to multiple mucosal neuromas. To describe a family with cutaneous manifestations not previously described in patients with MEN 2A syndrome and to discuss the association of this disorder with Cowden syndrome. Clinicopathologic correlation of cutaneous lesions and genetic studies in 11 members of a family with familial MTC. Cutaneous lesions were histopathologically and immunohistochemically studied. Genetic screening for a germline mutation at the RET gene was performed in 11 family members. Identification of cutaneous lesions not previously described in patients with MEN 2A syndrome. This family of 11 individuals with familial MTC type of MEN 2A syndrome demonstrated the moderate risk RET p.Val804Met (protein valine at residue 804 replaced by methionine) genetic mutation, with 2 of the relatives presenting with dermal hyperneury, cutaneous lesions classically described in MEN 2B syndrome, and 1 relative also showing multiple sclerotic fibromas, a cutaneous manifestation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) hamartoma-tumor syndrome.

29049424,"Digital pathology represents a transformative technology that impacts dermatologists and dermatopathologists from residency to academic and private practice. Two concerns are accuracy of interpretation from whole-slide images (WSI) and effect on workflow. Studies of considerably large series involving single-organ systems are lacking. To evaluate whether diagnosis from WSI on a digital microscope is inferior to diagnosis of glass slides from traditional microscopy (TM) in a large cohort of dermatopathology cases with attention on image resolution, specifically eosinophils in inflammatory cases and mitotic figures in melanomas, and to measure the workflow efficiency of WSI compared with TM. Three dermatopathologists established interobserver ground truth consensus (GTC) diagnosis for 499 previously diagnosed cases proportionally representing the spectrum of diagnoses seen in the laboratory. Cases were distributed to 3 different dermatopathologists who diagnosed by WSI and TM with a minimum 30-day washout between methodologies. Intraobserver WSI/TM diagnoses were compared, followed by interobserver comparison with GTC. Concordance, major discrepancies, and minor discrepancies were calculated and analyzed by paired noninferiority testing. We also measured pathologists' read rates to evaluate workflow efficiency between WSI and TM. This retrospective study was caried out in an independent, national, university-affiliated dermatopathology laboratory. Intraobserver concordance of diagnoses between WSI and TM methods and interobserver variance from GTC, following College of American Pathology guidelines. Mean intraobserver concordance between WSI and TM was 94%. Mean interobserver concordance was 94% for WSI and GTC and 94% for TM and GTC. Mean interobserver concordance between WSI, TM, and GTC was 91%. Diagnoses from WSI were noninferior to those from TM. Whole-slide image read rates were commensurate with WSI experience, achieving parity with TM by the most experienced user. Diagnosis from WSI was found equivalent to diagnosis from glass slides using TM in this statistically powerful study of 499 dermatopathology cases. This study supports the viability of WSI for primary diagnosis in the clinical setting.",skin_neoplasms

Patients who were treated with PCRT for LARC from 2015 January to 2016 December were retrospectively enrolled. Total doses of 45 Gy to 50.4 Gy with 3D-CRT or SIB-IMRT were administered concomitantly with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin or capecitabine. Surgery was performed 8 weeks after PCRT. Between PCRT and surgery, one cycle of additional chemotherapy was administered. Pathologic tumor responses were compared between SIB-IMRT and 3D-CRT groups. Acute gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematologic, and skin toxicities were compared between the two groups based on the RTOG toxicity criteria. SIB-IMRT was used in 53 patients, and 3D-CRT in 41 patients. After PCRT, no significant differences were noted in tumor responses, pathologic complete response (9% vs. 7%; p = 1.000), pathologic tumor regression Grade 3 or higher (85% vs. 71%; p = 0.096), and R0 resection (87% vs. 85%; p = 0.843). Grade 2 genitourinary toxicities were significantly lesser in the SIB-IMRT group (8% vs. 24%; p = 0.023), but gastrointestinal toxicities were not different across the two groups.

Assess the hemostatic effect of topically applied brimonidine in patients being treated with anticoagulants and undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Subjects undergoing MMS were randomly assigned to the control (n?=?10) or study arm (n?=?14). Controls received standard-of-care MMS, whereas the study arm received the same and preoperative application of brimonidine. Evaluations included rate of blood flow, percentage of wound bed surface area needing electrocautery, and changes in skin colorimeter readings. The treatment arm had 68% less blood loss over 30?seconds versus the control arm (P?<?.05). No patient in the brimonidine arm had more than 50% of the wound bed cauterized versus 80% in the controls. Erythema in the treatment arm was decreased by 3.89 times (P?<?.01) versus in the control arm. Limitations were small sample size; sites limited to the face; the fact that measurement of bleeding did not account for anesthetic mixed with blood; visual estimation of percentage of wound surface area requiring cauterization; and no measurement of volume of anesthesia, wound depth, or postoperative complications.

This has driven a demand for new strategies to decrease patient waiting time and administrative costs. The aim of this study was to determine if a purpose-built See and Treat skin cancer clinic could provide a faster skin cancer treatment pathway with comparable clinical outcomes and acceptability to patients. This was a prospective observational study of patients treated through the See and Treat clinic with a retrospective control cohort. The prospective 'See and Treat' cohort included a consecutive series of 106 patients, while the retrospective cohort included a consecutive series of 200 patients. Patient demographics, time from referral to surgery and operative measures were analysed. One hundred patients in the prospective cohort completed an anonymous satisfaction survey regarding their treatment. The average time from referral to surgery was reduced from 121?days in the retrospective cohort to 60?days in the See and Treat cohort (P?<?0.001). Rates of complete excision of malignant and premalignant lesions were not different between the two groups, being 93% (178/191) and 91% (76/84), respectively (P?=?0.609). Ninety-five percent (95/100) of patients were satisfied with their See and Treat experience overall. We show that a considerable reduction in the time between referral and surgery can be achieved through a See and Treat clinic without compromise of the success of surgical treatment. Moreover, such a treatment pathway has been shown to be acceptable, and largely preferable, to patients.",skin_neoplasms

Analysis of individual-level Medicare data for keratinocyte cancer treatments (identified by eight specific MBS item codes) during 2011-2014. Histological data from the QSkin prospective cohort study were analysed to estimate BCC and SCC incidence. A 10% systematic random sample of all people registered with Medicare during 1997-2014. People aged at least 20 years in 2011 who made at least one claim for any MBS medical service during 2011-2014 (1 704 193 individuals). Age-standardised incidence rates (ASRs) and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs). The person-based incidence of keratinocyte cancer excisions in Australia was 1531 per 100 000 person-years; incidence increased with age, and was higher for men than women (SIR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.42-1.45). Lesion-based incidence was 3154 per 100 000 person-years. The estimated ASRs for BCC and SCC were 770 per 100 000 and 270 per 100 000 person-years respectively. During 2011-2014, 3.9% of Australians had one keratinocyte cancer excised, 2.7% had more than one excised; 74% of skin cancers were excised from patients who had two or more lesions removed. Multiplicity was strongly correlated with age; most male patients over 70 were treated for multiple lesions. Keratinocyte cancer incidence was eight times as high among people with a prior history of excisions as among those without. The incidence and multiplicity of keratinocyte cancer in Australia are very high, causing a large disease burden that has not previously been quantified.",skin_neoplasms

The authors compared the pain felt during injection of local anesthetic using a minimal needle insertion technique with a 30- or 33-gauge needle. Three hundred eighteen patients with tumors on the head and neck were injected with lidocaine using a previously described technique with either a 30- or 33-gauge needle. After injection, patients were surveyed using the visual assessment scale for pain. Seventy-seven percent of patients felt no pain with injection on the face using a 33-gauge needle compared with 64% with a 30 gauge, whereas 94% of patients felt no pain on the scalp with a 33-gauge needle compared with 54% with a 30 gauge. Visual analog scale scores were also significantly decreased on the face and scalp using the smaller needle. There was no difference in pain between the 2 needles with injection on the neck.

This was a retrospective study enrolling 252 patients with LyP. Topical steroids, methotrexate and phototherapy were the most common first-line treatments, prescribed for 35%, 20% and 14% of the patients, respectively. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 48% of treated patients. Eczematous lesions significantly increased relative risk (RR) of not achieving CR (RR?=?1.76; 95% CI 1.16-2.11). Overall median time to CR was 10?months (95% CI 6-13?months), and 78% of complete responders showed cutaneous relapse; both results were similar for all treatment groups (P?>?0.05). Overall estimated median disease-free survival (DFS) was 11?months (95% CI 9-13?months) but DFS for patients treated with phototherapy was 23?months (95% CI 10-36?months; P?<?0.03).

Evidence is lacking on the safety of breast reconstructive operations in these patients. We hypothesized that targeted HER-2 therapy was not associated with post-mastectomy reconstructive outcomes. Women receiving chemotherapy and post-mastectomy reconstruction at Duke University Medical Center from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively identified. Patients receiving targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab within 6 weeks before breast reconstruction were propensity score-matched 1:1 to patients who did not receive targeted HER-2 therapy, based on the following factors: age, obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, and radiation therapy. Primary study outcomes included the occurrence of hematoma, seroma, infection, wound breakdown, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, and postoperative flap thrombosis. A total of 481 women were identified, resulting in 107 propensity score-matched pairs. Administration of combined trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy before breast reconstruction was independently associated with increased risk of postoperative wound breakdown requiring operative intervention for closure, compared with patients not undergoing targeted HER-2 therapy (odds ratio 65.29; 95% CI 1.63 to 2,611.50; p?= 0.03). In addition, larger tumor size (2 to 5 cm) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative wound breakdown, compared with smaller tumors (<2 cm) (odds ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p?= 0.02). Single-agent targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab was not significantly associated with reconstructive complications. Our study suggests that trastuzumab therapy in conjunction with breast reconstructive operation is not associated with reconstructive complications, and breast reconstruction does not need to be delayed due to the administration of trastuzumab.

28982843,"Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, with increasing frequency and mortality. Melanoma is characterized by rapid proliferation and metastases. Malignant transformation of normal melanocytes is associated with imbalance between oncogenes' action and tumor suppressor genes. Mutations or inactivation of these genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma. Many target-specific agents improved progression-free survival but unfortunately metastatic melanoma remains incurable, so new therapeutic strategies are needed. The balance of histones' acetylation affects cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are associated with different types of cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) are enzymes that inhibit the action of HDAC, resulting in block of tumor cell proliferation. A small number of these enzymes has been studied regarding their anticancer effects in melanoma. The purpose of this article was to review the therapeutic effect of HDACI against malignant melanoma, enlightening the molecular mechanisms of their action. The MEDLINE database was used. The keywords/ phrases were; HDACI, melanoma, targeted therapies for melanoma. Our final conclusions were based on studies that didn't refer solely to melanoma due to their wider experimental data. Thirty-two articles were selected from the total number of the search's results. Only English articles published until March 2017 were used.

Intravenous brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes every 21 days. The primary end point was the overall response rate. Complete response was defined as zero lesions, and partial response was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in lesion count from baseline. A relapse was defined as loss of partial response. All 12 patients (8 men and 4 women; median age, 46 years) responded to brentuximab vedotin, and 7 exhibited a complete response. Time to response was 3 weeks in all patients. The median duration of response was 20 weeks (range, 6-103 weeks). For 5 patients who relapsed, the median time to relapse was 12 weeks (range, 6-41 weeks).

The majority of responders affirmed that PORT should be performed in early-stage (stages I and II) breast cancer for patients who present with risk factors for relapse after SSM and NSM. They considered age, lymph node involvement, tumor size, extracapsular extension, involved surgical margins, lymphovascular invasion, triple negative receptor status and multicentric presentation as major risk factors. Considering that after SSM and NSM, residual breast tissue can be left behind, the residual tissue considered as acceptable in the context of an oncologic surgery were 1-5?mm for breast surgeons. There is no consensus for the necessity of evaluating residual breast tissue through breast imaging. Although the indications of PORT after SSM and NSM vary among practitioners, standard risk factors for relapse are considered as important by radiation oncologists and breast surgeons.",skin_neoplasms

28961561,"Head and neck radiation therapy (HNRT) impairs baroreflex sensitivity, and it may potentiate the effects of anesthetics on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) regulation. Currently, the impacts of HNRT on HR and BP under anesthesia remain unclear. In this study, 472 patients with primary oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer at all stages were examined. Half of the patients underwent HNRT plus surgery. The other half underwent surgery only and was matched with the treatment patients according to age, sex, and body mass index at a 1:1 ratio. The HRs and BPs in the 2 groups during anesthetic induction, skin incision, and emergence were compared retrospectively. A multivariable model of repeated measures with unstructured covariance structure was used to examine the associations of HNRT with intraoperative HRs and BPs after adjusting for baseline HR and BP, time, use of ²-blockers, history of chemotherapy, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score. BPs and HRs were collected every 5 minutes. The baseline HR and BP measurements were not included in the outcome vector and were only used as adjustment for baselines. Compared with corresponding baseline values in controls, the baseline HR was significantly higher (P = .0012) and the baseline systolic BP was lower (P < .0001) in the treatment group. The baseline diastolic BP levels did not differ significantly (P = .6411). Fewer patients receiving HNRT than controls took ²-blockers daily (17% vs 28%; P = .0041). Comparing the corresponding values in control and treatment groups, multivariable analysis revealed significant associations of HNRT with decreases in HR during anesthesia induction (-2.21 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -4.42 to -0.01]; P = .0492) and skin incision (-2.66 [95% CI, -5.16 to -0.16]; P = .0373) and of HNRT with decreases in systolic BP during anesthesia induction (-6.88 [95% CI, -10.99 to -2.78]; P = .0011) and skin incision (-15.87 [95% CI, -20.45 to -11.29]; P < .001). However, we observed a significant association of HNRT with decrease in diastolic BP only during skin incision (-6.50 [95% CI, -9.47 to -3.53]; P < .0001). The significant finding in the study was that general anesthesia imposed a negative chronotropic effect on HR in the group given HNRT.

In this multicenter study, patients with C-ALCL who had been treated with radiation therapy (RT) between 1984 and 2016 were retrieved from the Dutch registry of cutaneous lymphomas. Distinction was made between patients first presenting with solitary or localized lesions (n=63), with multifocal skin lesions (n=6), and patients with a skin relapse (n=22). Radiation doses, treatment response, and follow-up were evaluated. Radiation doses were categorized as low-dose (¡Â20?Gy), intermediate-dose (21-39?Gy), and high-dose (¡Ã40?Gy) RT. Of 63 patients presenting with solitary or localized skin lesions, 61 (97%) showed a complete response (CR). There were no differences in CR between low-dose (16 of 17), intermediate-dose (15 of 15), and high-dose RT (30 of 31). After a median follow-up of 46?months, 30 of 63 patients (48%) had a relapse, but in-field relapses were never observed. Six of 6 patients (100%) initially presenting with multifocal skin lesions showed a CR (3 of 3 low-dose, 2 of 2 intermediate-dose, 1 of 1 high-dose RT).

C-KIT exon 11 ITDs were detected by PCR in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine MCTs sourced from three veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Adelaide and Melbourne. Tumours were graded according to two different systems (Patnaik and Kiupel systems) by board-certified anatomical pathologists blinded to the PCR results. Relationships between tumour mutation status and prognostic factors were evaluated using a generalised binary logistic regression analysis. ITDs were identified in 13 of 74 cutaneous canine MCT samples, giving an overall prevalence of 17.6% (95% confidence interval: 8.9-26.2%). ITDs were detected in 10 of 18 Patnaik grade III MCTs (55.6%) and 11 of 22 Kiupel high-grade MCTs (50%). Wald chi-square analysis revealed that detection of tumour ITDs was significantly associated with both Patnaik's and Kiupel's histologic grading systems (each: P?<?0.001). The presence of the ITDs in MCTs was not associated with signalment, tumour anatomical location or tumour size. The prevalence of C-KIT exon 11 ITDs in Australian canine MCTs is similar to the prevalence in overseas canine populations (overall prevalence in Australia approximately 18%).

Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) utilization increased on the head/neck, hands/feet, and genitalia (increasing from 11% to 27% of all treatment procedures) but was low on the trunk/extremities (increasing from 1% to 4%). Adjusted for increased Medicare enrollment (+36%) between 2000 and 2015, the number of biopsies and MMS procedures performed per 1000 beneficiaries increased (from 56 to 99 and from 5 to 15, respectively), whereas the number of excisions and destructions changed minimally (from 18 to 16 and from 19 to 18, respectively). Growth in biopsies and MMS procedures slowed between each time period studied: 4.3 additional biopsies per year and 0.9 additional MMS procedures per year per 1000 beneficiaries between 2000 and 2007, 2.2 and 0.5 more between 2008 and 2011, and 0.5 and 0.3 more between 2012 and 2015, respectively.

Therefore, we focused our attention on human cancer stem cells (CSCs) as targets of cancer prevention and treatment with EGCG. The numerous reports concerning anticancer activity of EGCG against human CSCs enriched from cancer cell lines were gathered from a search of PubMed, and we hope our review of the literatures will provide a broad selection for the effects of EGCG on various human CSCs. Based on our theoretical study, we discuss the findings as follows: (1) Compared with the parental cells, human CSCs express increased levels of the stemness markers Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, CD44, CD133, as well as the EMT markers, Twist, Snail, vimentin, and also aldehyde dehydrogenase. They showed decreased levels of E-cadherin and cyclin D1. (2) EGCG inhibits the transcription and translation of genes encoding stemness markers, indicating that EGCG generally inhibits the self-renewal of CSCs. (3) EGCG inhibits the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypes of human CSCs. (4) The inhibition of EGCG of the stemness of CSCs was weaker compared with parental cells. (5) The weak inhibitory activity of EGCG increased synergistically in combination with anticancer drugs.

The purpose of this article is to report the authors' experience with the use of the medial plantar artery perforator flap for reconstruction of defects of the foot sole in three different regions: heel, middle foot sole, and plantar forefoot. From January of 2003 to May of 2016, 28 patients (13 male and 15 female patients) with an average age of 54 years (range, 12 to 84 years) underwent reconstruction with 28 medial plantar artery perforator flaps. Twenty-six flaps were harvested as pedicle perforator flaps and two as free perforator flaps. All flaps were raised from the ipsilateral instep area. The defect locations included the heel (20 cases), middle foot sole (four cases), and forefoot (four cases). The causes of reconstruction were tumors in 18 patients, decubitus in eight patients, and trauma in two patients. The flap sizes varied from 2.5 ¡¿ 2.5 cm to 5.5 ¡¿ 9.5 cm. All of the flaps survived completely after surgery, apart from one. The donor sites were all covered with a split-thickness skin graft. Follow-up observations were conducted for 4 to 12 months, and all patients had good functional recovery with satisfactory cosmetic results.

These patients did not fit the rigid criteria of a clinical trial and represented the use of regorafenib in an everyday clinic situation. Regorafenib (160?mg P.O. daily) was administered to patients on a 4-week cycle (3 weeks on, 1 week off) until disease progression (assessed using mRECIST criteria) or discontinuation secondary to toxicity (assessed using CTCAE criteria). Relevant clinical data were abstracted from patient medical records and reviewed retrospectively. The median duration of patient treatment was 6.6?weeks, and the median time to disease progression was 12.5?weeks. Most common treatment emergent adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot skin reaction. Elevated AST and ALT were the most commonly observed laboratory-assessed adverse events, which reached grade 3 status in the Child-Pugh class B patients only. We observed intolerance to regorafenib treatment in one patient who had previously received a liver transplant. We also saw lithium toxicity in one patient receiving long-term lithium treatment, suggesting a potential and unexpected drug-drug interaction with regorafenib.

Exposure to UV radiation is one of the main risk factors for this type of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of UV radiation in an airliner in flight. Measurements were taken with a three sensor-integrated electronics UV radiometer (A, B, and C) during 14 flights from July to October 2016. They were performed during daylight hours once the airliner had reached cruising altitude. We failed to find UVC radiation. The measurements detected neither UV A nor B in any parts of the cabins of the planes tested, nor in the Airbus cockpits. UVA radiation was however found in the cockpit of Boeing 777s. But UVA levels remained well below the values found at ground level and they were also strongly reduced (more than 10 times) by cockpit sun visors. Few studies have assessed the level of UV radiation in an airplane. They suggested that the cockpit windshields reduced this type of radiation to some degree (according mainly to the wavelength of the radiation and the nature of the windshield).

In addition, IPD from two studies comparing IFN and vaccination in 989 patients were included. A two-level modeling approach was used for assessing Spearman's patient-level correlation (rho) of RFS and OS and the trial-level coefficient of determination (R²) of the treatment effects on RFS and on OS. The results were validated externally in 13 adjuvant studies without available IPD. We then tested the results on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071 double-blind trial comparing ipilimumab 10	mg/kg with placebo, which showed a statistically significant impact of the checkpoint inhibitor on RFS and OS.

Therefore, even if rho was high, R² was low and could not reliably be estimated. Based on the 12 trials, rho remained high (0.89), and the hazard ratios for RFS and OS were strongly correlated (R² = 0.91). The surrogate threshold effect for RFS was estimated to be 0.77.

28915833,"We present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. Although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. Reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. The deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. The internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. A 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. He underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. The defect was covered with an ipsilateral deltopectoral flap via transposition of the flap, without skin grafting. In the second case, a 67-year-old woman with thyroid cancer that metastasized to her neck lymph nodes presented to our institution. Although the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery was sacrificed near its origin during tumor resection, the deltopectoral flap was raised in the usual manner without any complications. The skin defect caused by the tumor resection was covered with the flap. The patient had an uneventful clinical course for more than 2 years of follow-up. These 2 cases show the effectiveness of using the deltopectoral flap as a reconstructive option for patients with thyroid cancer who underwent radical surgery, resulting in a skin defect. The first case shows that this flap does not always require skin grafting to the donor site. To our knowledge, the second case may be the first report of a deltopectoral flap that was safely raised and applied with resection of the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery. Although thyroid cancer surgery with surrounding skin excision is a rare procedure, we found that the deltopectoral flap was useful and should be the first choice for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery, whether the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery is sacrificed.",skin_neoplasms

It often occurs in the cartilage of the pelvis, femur, tibia, and humerus. However, chondrosarcoma of the patella is extremely rare. The present study describes a case of chondrosarcoma affecting the right patella in a 68-year-old woman. The chief complaints were painful swelling and limitation of motion of the right knee for about half a year. The pain was a kind of dull ache. The skin around the right knee was red and hot. Moreover, she had a claudication gait due to the symptoms. Irregular lytic lesions with ill-defined margins in the patella were determined through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of primary grade II chondrosarcoma was finally confirmed on the basis of postoperative pathological examination. The patient underwent an open surgery named extensive resection of patellar tumor to remove the tumor tissue completely. The patient was discharged without any complications 1 week after the surgery. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient was completely free from pain during daily activities, and normal range of motion of the right knee was achieved. Her gait was normal. There was no evidence of recurrence. We believe that an extensive resection is suitable for treating chondrosarcoma to avoid as far as possible local recurrence.

The primary end point was relapse-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, freedom from relapse, and safety. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival was 58% in the combination-therapy group and 39% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.58; P<0.001). The 3-year overall survival rate was 86% in the combination-therapy group and 77% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.79; P=0.0006), but this level of improvement did not cross the prespecified interim analysis boundary of P=0.000019. Rates of distant metastasis-free survival and freedom from relapse were also higher in the combination-therapy group than in the placebo group. The safety profile of dabrafenib plus trametinib was consistent with that observed with the combination in patients with metastatic melanoma. Adjuvant use of combination therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib resulted in a significantly lower risk of recurrence in patients with stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations than the adjuvant use of placebo and was not associated with new toxic effects.

However, there is no consensus on the complementary tests that should be requested?or the appropriate intervals between visits. Our aim is to compare an ultrasound-based follow-up with a clinical follow-up. Analysis of two prospectively collected cohorts of melanoma patients in stage IB-IIA from two tertiary referral centres in Barcelona (clinical-based follow-up [C-FU]) and Turin (ultrasound-based follow-up [US-FU]). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), disease-free interval (DFI), nodal metastases-free survival (NMFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). A total of 1149 patients in the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IB and IIA were included in this study, of which 554 subjects (48%) were enrolled for a C-FU, and 595 patients (52%) received a protocolised US-FU. The median age was 53.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41.5-65.2) with a median follow-up time of 4.14 years (IQR 1.2-7.6). During follow-up, 69 patients (12.5%) in C-FU and 72 patients (12.1%) in US-FU developed disease progression. Median time to relapse for the first metastatic site was 2.11 years (IQR 1.14-4.04) for skin metastases, 1.32 (IQR 0.57-3.29) for lymph node metastases and 2.84 (IQR 1.32-4.60) for distant metastases. The pattern of progression and the total proportion of metastases?were not significantly different (P?=?.44) in the two centres.

28885696,"Nearly 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer, and as a result, survivors of skin cancer compose one of the largest groups of cancer survivors. Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are an important tool for improving patient outcomes and provide critical information to both survivors and health care professionals. Recent efforts have been made to expand SCP utilization; however, which patients currently receive SCPs is poorly understood. This study used 596 individuals with a diagnosis of melanoma (n = 391) or nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 205) who had used an Internet-based SCP tool from May 2010 to December 2016 to model the patient and provider characteristics that determine SCP utilization. Survivors were predominantly white (95.3%) and female (56.5%). Survivors who received a treatment summary were more likely to also receive an SCP. University and nonuniversity cancer centers used SCPs at a higher rate than other care settings. Survivors whose care was managed by a team rather than just an individual physician were also more likely to receive an SCP. Survivors older than 70 years at diagnosis were almost twice as likely to receive a plan as survivors who were diagnosed at a younger age. With a convenience sample of skin cancer survivors, it is possible to model factors that predict the receipt of SCPs. Important variables include the diagnosis age, treatment setting, physician type, and treatment-summary utilization. A closer examination of these variables identified several disparities in care-plan use and, therefore, opportunities to improve the distribution of SCPs. Further validation in additional cohorts of survivors is necessary to confirm these conclusions. Cancer 2018;124:183-91. ? 2017 American Cancer Society.",skin_neoplasms

We conducted a prospective quality improvement study. Patients who underwent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer cytoreductive surgery at an academic tertiary care center from April 2014 to April 2016 were prospectively enrolled. Patient demographics, surgical variables, and surgical site infection rates were compared with a historical cohort after introduction of a 5-point infection prevention bundle, including: 1) preoperative and intraoperative skin preparation with 4% chlorhexidine and intraoperative vaginal preparation with 4% chlorhexidine; 2) preoperative use of oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation; 3) appropriate timing of intraoperative antibiotics; 4) adoption of enhanced sterile surgical techniques for colon procedures and incisional closure; and 5) perioperative incision management. During the study period, 219 women underwent surgery: 91 prebundle and 128 treated in the postbundle period. Stage, body mass index, proportion of patients undergoing colon or upper abdominal surgery, and estimated blood loss were not different between the cohorts. Overall, the surgical site infection rate prebundle was 18 (20%); this was reduced to four (3%) postbundle (odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.037-0.53; P<.001). Patients who underwent a colon resection prebundle had an infection rate of 14 (33%) compared with three (7%) in the postbundle group (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.037-0.53; P<.001). Additionally, rates of surgical site infection-related hospital readmission were also lower in the postbundle (4/128 [3%]) compared with the prebundle group (12/91 [13%]; P=.005).

We assess the risk of predicted SMNs following adjuvant proton radiation therapy compared with photon radiation therapy after resection of stage II thymic malignancies to determine whether proton therapy improves the risk-benefit ratio. Ten consecutive patients treated with double-scattered proton beam radiation therapy (DS-PBT) were prospectively enrolled in an institutional review board-approved proton registry study.

28870930,"In patients with melanoma, early dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes is frequently seen. Thus, besides clinical follow-up examination and imaging, reliable melanoma-specific serological tumor markers are needed. We retrospectively compared two serum markers for melanoma, S100 and melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA), for monitoring of patients with metastatic melanoma under either adjuvant or therapeutic vaccination immunotherapy with dendritic cells (DC). Serum was obtained from a total of 100 patients (28 patients in stage III and 72 patients in stage IV, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) at regular intervals during therapy, accompanied by follow-up imaging. When relapse was detected, both markers often remained within normal range. In contrast, in patients with metastatic measurable disease receiving therapeutic and not adjuvant DC vaccination, an increase of both markers was a strong indicator for disease progression. When comparing both markers in the whole study population, MIA showed a superior sensitivity to detect disease progression. S100 and MIA are highly sensitive tumor markers for monitoring of patients with melanoma with current metastases, but less sensitive for monitoring of tumor-free patients. In the current study, MIA had a slightly superior sensitivity to detect progressive disease compared to S100 and seems to be more useful in monitoring of patients with metastatic melanoma receiving immunotherapy.",skin_neoplasms

Given its rarity and recent recognition as a distinct pathological entity, no standard of treatment exists for this aggressive disease and its prognosis is particularly dismal. We retrospectively analyzed clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients who were diagnosed with BPDCN between 2000 and 2014. Ten patients had a median age at diagnosis of 41 years (range, 18 to 79), and seven patients were male. Sites of disease involvement were the skin (n = 7), lymph node (n = 5), bone marrow (n = 2), liver (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), and soft tissue (n = 1). Intensified chemotherapy regimens such as hyperCVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, cytarabine), and VPDL (vincristine, methylprednisolone, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase) were used as a first-line treatment. Although all patients treated with intensified chemotherapy showed an objective response (five patients with complete response) with median progression-free survival of 11.2 months (range 6.2 to 19.4), complete remission was not sustained for more than 2 years in any case. The response was relatively long-lived compared with previously reported CHOP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone)-like regimens, but the above regimens do not result in long-term remission.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation mimicking metastasis of melanoma in the literature. A 43-year-old white man presented with a newly found splenic mass 4?years ago to our Department of Gastroenterology. He was diagnosed as having a superficial spreading malignant melanoma localized at his left instep 7?years ago and was successfully treated with radical local resection. Several diagnostic procedures were conducted. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the inferior pole of his spleen with a diameter of 2?cm, blurred boundaries, and inhomogeneous interior pattern. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was inconclusive and showed only discrete contrast enhancement of the lesion with accentuated nodule-like enrichment of the boundaries in the arterial phase. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed two splenic lesions which were highly suspicious of metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging of his head was inconspicuous. Bone scintigraphy showed no abnormal results. Fine-needle aspiration indicated metastasis of the above-mentioned malignant melanoma. We conducted a laparoscopic splenectomy. His intraoperative and postoperative course were uneventful. In contrast to the result of the fine-needle aspiration, the presence of metastasis of melanoma could not be confirmed. Histological analysis revealed nodule-like arrangement of fibroblasts with low cell density and a predominance of dilated capillaries, indicating sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen. There are no preoperative diagnostic imaging procedures which can definitely differentiate sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation from malignancies in cases of morphological and immunophenotypic variations of the specimen. Morphological and immunophenotypic variations of the specimen represent a diagnostic challenge and can mimic malignoma.

In particular TLR7 is an interesting candidate, as TLR7 agonists are broadly used for the treatment of cutaneous tumors. However, data addressing the baseline expression of TLR7 in both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the protein level are lacking, while on the genomic level significantly elevated expression of TLR7 in SCC but not in BCC has been demonstrated. Our aim was to characterize the immunohistochemical staining pattern of TLR7 in SCC and BCC. Besides, we aimed to clarify if, in case of different TLR7 expression between SCC and BCC, TLR7 expression would help to define basosquamous carcinoma (BSC), a tumor entity sharing characteristics of both SCC and BCC. We examined histopathological samples from 23 BCC, 4 BSC, and 24 SCC and characterized the expression of TLR7 by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We found that TLR7 was not expressed by the tumor tissue of SCC, BCC, and BSC, but by inflammatory cells located within the tumoral and/or peritumoral tissue. Whereas the overall expression of TLR7 did not differ between BCC and SCC (30.4% vs. 45.8%, respectively), we found that within the group of SCC, the well-differentiated SCC showed strong tumoral and/or peritumoral immunocellular TLR7 reactivity in contrast to the poorly differentiated SCC (73.33% vs. 11.1%, respectively). Besides, immunofluorescence double staining revealed the expression of TLR7 in immune cells closely interacting with T cells and natural killer cells. In contrast to genomic data, we did not find a general difference between baseline TLR7 expression of SCC and BCC on the protein level. Nevertheless, the expression of TLR7 by the inflammatory infiltrate associated with SCC may correlate with the degree of differentiation of SCC possibly indicating better outcome.",skin_neoplasms

A 36-year-old female presented with debilitating pain of the right upper extremity secondary to a recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. She had distant metastasis to the lung. An MRI revealed a 25-cm shoulder mass involving the proximal arm muscles with encasement of the axillary artery, vein, and brachial plexus. A palliative forequarter amputation was performed and tumor thrombus was evident within the axillary artery and vein. Postoperatively, she developed an acute onset of dyspnea and hypoxia. A computed tomography scan revealed a pulmonary saddle embolism. A bilateral lower extremity venous duplex was negative. She became hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitation and was placed on vasopressor support. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed elevated pulmonary artery pressure, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart dilation, and reduced right heart systolic function consistent with acute cor pulmonale.

A KRAB-containing zinc finger protein member, zinc finger 23 (ZNF23), was reduced in some types of tumors and inhibited cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest. However, the role of ZNF23 expression is still poorly understood in melanoma. The level of ZNF23 expression was detected in cutaneous melanoma, adjacent normal skin tissues and cutaneous melanoma cell lines using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The correlations between ZNF23 expression and other clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed in melanoma patients. Ectopic expression of ZNF23 plasmid was transfected into melanoma cells, SK-MEL-1 and SK-MEL-28. MTT, flow cytometry and transwell assay were used to measure cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration abilities, respectively. Mitochondrial functions and structures were detected by mitochondrial membrane potential assay and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method in melanoma cells transfected with overexpressing ZNF23 plasmid or empty vector. Western blotting was performed to detect the levels of ZNF23, p53, p27, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 after overexpressing of ZNF23 in melanoma cells. ZNF23 was elevated in adjacent normal skin tissues compared with melanoma tissues. Patients with low level of ZNF23 expression exhibited higher incidence of lymphoid metastasis, thicker size of tumors and worse outcome. By using Cox's regression analysis, ZNF23 expression, tumor thickness and lymph node metastasis were the independent prognostic factors for overall survival (p < 0.05). Results from cellular experiments indicated that ectopic expression of ZNF23 induced cell apoptosis by activation of caspase-3, p27, p53 expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 through mitochondria-dependent pathway. Decreased ZNF23 was contributed to melanoma progression and poor survival with mitochondria-dependent pathway.

Two dermoscopic features, salmon-coloured area/background and serpentine vessels, are frequently seen in PCBCL lesions. These characteristic dermoscopic features, although not specific, can suggest a possible diagnosis of PCBCL.",skin_neoplasms

28844095,"Polyarthritis can have numerous reasons and may thus constitute a challenge for differential diagnosis. One rare potential reason for sterile polyarthritis is underlying pancreatic disease with systemic hyperlipasemia, most often accompanied by painful skin lesions caused by a subcutaneous inflammatory process known as panniculitis. Systematic evidence on pancreatic panniculitis and polyarthritis is limited, particularly regarding its feature as facultative paraneoplasia with underlying intra- or even extra-pancreatic malignancy. Therefore, we will summarize the current knowledge about this orphan disease including epidemiological, pathophysiological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects in the present review. Although direct evidence is lacking, it is highly probable that pancreatic polyarthritis and panniculitis are caused by peripheral lipolytic activity of lipase systemically circulating due to benign (e.g., acute or chronic pancreatitis) or malign (e.g., acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) or adenocarcinoma) pancreatic disease. In the latter case, pancreatic polyarthritis and panniculitis are associated with poor outcome. Pancreatic polyarthritis and panniculitis should always be included into diagnostic considerations, and once suspected, a thorough work-up to identify the underlying disease has to be performed.",skin_neoplasms
28843749,"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive disease and its incidence is increasing worldwide. Genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental factors, especially sunlight, are risk factors. Histopathologic distinction between nevi and melanomas can be difficult. It is anticipated that the evaluation of the immunohistochemical expression of some genes could contribute to the differential diagnosis of questionable histologically lesions. The objective of this study was to investigate wether the evaluation of the immunohistochemical expression of genes CADM1, TWIST1 and CDH1 (E-cadherin), that take part in mechanisms of cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributes to the differential diagnosis of melanocytic lesions difficult to diagnose. Retrospective cross-sectional study based on immunohistochemistry analysis of samples of 30 dysplastic compound melanocytic nevi, 30 melanomas less than 1.0mm thick and 30 melanomas more than 1.0mm thick, diagnosed between 2013 and 2016. A score was used to evaluate color intensity and percentage of cells stained. There were significant reductions in the expression of the genes CADM1 and CDH1 in melanomas (below and above 1.00mm of thickness) and in melanomas more than 1.0mm thick, respectively, compared to dysplastic compund melanocytic nevi. There was also lower expression of the genes CADM1 and CDH1 in melanomas greater than 1.0mm thick compared to melanomas less than 1.0mm. The gene TWIST1 showed no significant difference in expression between groups. These findings allow us to conclude that the immunohistochemical expression of CADM1 has the potential to contribute as an auxiliary tool to the differential diagnosis between nevi and melanomas.",skin_neoplasms

To assess practices and acceptability to Black African mothers of sun protection equipment for their children living in a rural area, participants were recruited at the time of their child's 18-month vaccinations. Mothers completed a baseline questionnaire on usual sun behaviours and sun protection practices. They were then provided with sun protection equipment and advice. A follow-up questionnaire was administered two weeks later. Mothers reported that during the week prior to the baseline questionnaire, children spent on average less than 1 hour of time outdoors (most often spent in the shade). Most mothers (97%) liked the sun protection equipment. However, many (78 of 86) reported that their child did not like any of the sun protection equipment and two-thirds stated that the sun protection equipment was not easy to use. Among Black Africans in rural northern South Africa, we found a mismatch between parental preferences and child acceptance for using sun protection when outdoors. A better understanding of the health risks of incidental excess sun exposure and potential benefits of sun protection is required among Black Africans.",skin_neoplasms

In this pre-clinical study, we combined radiation with the leading VDA in clinical development, combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P), and compared the effects seen in tumors and relevant normal tissues. 3 foot implanted C3H mammary carcinomas was assessed using percent tumor control at 90 days. Normal tissue effects were evaluated using early responding skin (development of moist desquamation in the foot at 11-30 days), and late responding bladder (50% reduction in reservoir function estimated by cystometry up to 9 months after treatment), and lung (20% increase in ventilation rate measured by plethysmography within 9 months). A Chi-squared test was used for statistical comparisons (significance level of p?<?.05). The radiation dose controlling 50% of irradiated tumors was 52?Gy. This significantly decreased to 45?Gy with CA4P. The radiation doses inducing a change in skin, bladder and lung response in 50% of mice were 31?Gy, 14?Gy and 12?Gy, respectively. CA4P had no significant effect on the radiation response of any of these normal tissues.

We report a NF1 patient who received surgical treatment for rectal carcinoma and multifocal small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). A 70-year-old female patient with NF1 was referred to our hospital after a positive fecal occult blood test. Locally advanced rectal carcinoma was detected in the upper rectum using colonoscopy. A submucosal tumor 20?mm in diameter was detected in the duodenal bulb during the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The biopsy specimen from the duodenum was GIST with positive immunostaining of KIT and CD34 microscopically. Laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma and local excision of the duodenal GIST were performed successfully. During the operation, five white small nodules were found on the serosa of the jejunum. One nodule was excised for histological examination. The resected rectal tumor was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with multiple lymph nodes metastases according to the histology. The duodenal tumor was found to be low-risk GIST. Moreover, the nodule from the jejunum was very low risk GIST. An excised skin wart was neurofibroma according to the histology. GIST or carcinomas have been reported to occasionally occur in the digestive tract of the patients with NF1.

They are diagnosed at a median time of 48 months from primary tumor presentation, and survival of these patients is poorer when accompanied by other metastatic sites or malignant pleural effusion. We present a case of endobronchial melanoma metastasis happening 40 years after the initial diagnosis. The need of adjuvant techniques in the diagnosis of this tumor is highlighted and a short review on this rare phenomenon is provided. An 83-year old nonsmoking woman, presented with dyspnea. Left lung atelectasis was found. Endobronchial resection of a tumor of the left main stem bronchus was achieved by rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia with complete reventilation of the left lung. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostics of the resected tumor led to a diagnosis of an endobronchial melanoma metastasis.

We wish to report the treatment of two cases of ADPA with Mohs micrographic surgery and review the presentation, management, and prognosis of this rare malignancy. Cases of ADPA were identified from recent surgery logs. Demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were extracted. A PubMed database search for English language full-text articles of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma was performed, and relevant articles were summarized. Two cases of ADPA were identified. A 53-year-old man presented with ADPA on his right third fingernail, and a 65-year-old man presented with ADPA on his right thumb. Both patients underwent Mohs micrographic surgery and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, remaining recurrence free at 34 and 9 months, respectively. ADPA frequently presents as a solitary mass on the digit. Treatment of ADPA with local excision or amputation has historically been fraught with high recurrence rates. Regional lymph node spread and distant metastasis have been reported. Mohs micrographic surgery may be an alternative treatment for ADPA. Mohs micrographic surgery is a viable option for ADPA and warrants further exploration. Long-term follow-up is important, and additional studies will need to identify the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy.",skin_neoplasms

CD34 is the most commonly used antibody in differentiating these tumors. Various studies have stated the rates of D2-40 expression as 0-50% in DFSPs and 86-100% in DFs. Our aim in this study was to determine the expression of CD34 and D2-40 in DFs and DFSPs and the possible use of D2-40 in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. This is a retrospective study including 30 DF and 15 DFSP cases which were reevaluated for epidermal changes, the presence of a transmission zone (Grenz zone), infiltration of soft tissues, infiltration pattern and histologic subtypes in addition to cellular pleomorphism, nuclear atypia, and necrosis. A manual immunohistochemistry procedure was performed with D2-40 and CD 34 antibodies using a representative paraffin block. The average age was 37.36 and 42.86 years in the DF and DFSP cases. The average diameter was 0.9 and 5.03 cm, respectively, for the DFs and DFSPs. There was a significant correlation between the two entities for sex, localization and diameter of the lesion. A significant difference was found between the positivity of CD34 and D2-40 in DFs and DFSPs. Additional immunohistochemical markers may be needed in DFs with CD34 positivity.

Stringent ultraviolet protection is the only way to prevent skin cancer. Despite the risks, some patients' photoprotection is poor, with a potentially devastating impact on their prognosis. The aim of this research is to identify disease-specific and psychosocial predictors of photoprotection behaviour and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose to the face. Mixed methods research based on 45 UK patients will involve qualitative interviews to identify individuals' experience of XP and the influences on their photoprotection behaviours and a cross-sectional quantitative survey to assess biopsychosocial correlates of these behaviours at baseline. This will be followed by objective measurement of UVR exposure for 21 days by wrist-worn dosimeter and daily recording of photoprotection behaviours and psychological variables for up to 50 days in the summer months. This novel methodology will enable UVR dose reaching the face to be calculated and analysed as a clinically relevant endpoint. A range of qualitative and quantitative analytical approaches will be used, reflecting the mixed methods (eg, cross-sectional qualitative interviews, n-of-1 studies). Framework analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative interviews; mixed-effects longitudinal models will be used to examine the association of clinical and psychosocial factors with the average daily UVR dose; dynamic logistic regression models will be used to investigate participant-specific psychosocial factors associated with photoprotection behaviours.

28823644,"Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is a non-invasive vaccination strategy targeting the skin-associated lymphoid tissue. Topical application of the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as adjuvant in combination with peptide antigens activates the innate immune system and mounts cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Based on the commercial 5% imiquimod-containing drug Aldara we aimed to develop an improved formulation with superior vaccination efficiencies. The primary target was the enhancement of mast cell activation as important key for the function of the innate immune system. We investigated the effects of 9-phenanthrol (9-phe) on the activation of mast cells in vitro and in vivo. For TCI, we applied 0.2% 9-phe in Aldara or Aldara alone as adjuvants in combination with the MHC class I - restricted peptide SIINFEKL. To monitor vaccination, mast cell degranulation, migration of DC and frequencies of epitope-specific CTL was assessed. In a transgenic tumor model, the efficiencies of prophylactic immunization against a tumor antigen were also monitored. 9-phe induced degranulation of mast cells in vitro and upon topical application in vivo. A mixture of 0.2% 9-phe in Aldara showed superior results regarding the migration of DC and the expansion of antigen-specific CTL. Consequently, prophylactic immunization with 0.2% 9-phe in Aldara caused enhanced protection against tumor inoculation. Our data demonstrate that a simple modification of an adjuvant formulation can yield superior results in experimental vaccination protocols by boosting critical steps leading to the generation of an efficient CTL response.",skin_neoplasms

Comprehensive data on cancer diagnoses and deaths of MPM patients, their first-degree relatives, and matched controls were obtained through Swedish national health care and population registries. Familial MPM cases with germline CDKN2A mutations were youngest at the diagnosis of their second melanoma (median age 42 years) and had among the MPM cohorts the highest relative risks (RR) compared to controls of developing >2 melanomas (RR 238.4, 95% CI 74.8-759.9). CDKN2A mutated MPM cases and their first-degree relatives were the only cohorts with increased risks of nonskin cancers compared to controls (RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-147.1 and RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.9-5.6, respectively).

Computational systems have been developed to assist dermatologists in early diagnosis of skin cancer, or even to monitor skin lesions. However, there still remains a challenge to improve classifiers for the diagnosis of such skin lesions. The main objective of this article is to evaluate different ensemble classification models based on input feature manipulation to diagnose skin lesions. Input feature manipulation processes are based on feature subset selections from shape properties, colour variation and texture analysis to generate diversity for the ensemble models. Three subset selection models are presented here: (1) a subset selection model based on specific feature groups, (2) a correlation-based subset selection model, and (3) a subset selection model based on feature selection algorithms. Each ensemble classification model is generated using an optimum-path forest classifier and integrated with a majority voting strategy. The proposed models were applied on a set of 1104 dermoscopic images using a cross-validation procedure. The best results were obtained by the first ensemble classification model that generates a feature subset ensemble based on specific feature groups. The skin lesion diagnosis computational system achieved 94.3% accuracy, 91.8% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity. The input feature manipulation process based on specific feature subsets generated the greatest diversity for the ensemble classification model with very promising results.",skin_neoplasms

A prediction tool for NSN involvement could be of assistance in patient selection for CLND. This study investigated which parameters predict NSN-positivity, and whether the biomarker S-100B improves the accuracy of a prediction model. Recorded clinicopathologic factors were tested for their association with NSN-positivity in 110 SN-positive patients who underwent CLND. A prediction model was developed with multivariable logistic regression, incorporating all predictive factors. Five models were compared for their predictive power by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC). A weighted risk score, 'S-100B Non-Sentinel Node Risk Score' (SN-SNORS), was derived for the model with the highest AUC. Besides, a nomogram was developed as visual representation. NSN-positivity was present in 24 (21.8%) patients. Sex, ulceration, number of harvested SNs, number of positive SNs, and S-100B value were independently associated with NSN-positivity. The AUC for the model including all these factors was 0.78 (95%CI 0.69-0.88). SN-SNORS was the sum of scores for the five parameters. Scores of ¡Â9.5, 10-11.5, and ¡Ã12 were associated with low (0%), intermediate (21.0%) and high (43.2%) risk of NSN involvement. A prediction tool based on five parameters, including the biomarker S-100B, showed accurate risk stratification for NSN-involvement in SN-positive melanoma patients.

28797232,"Hotspot mutations of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS are the most common genetic alterations in cutaneous melanoma. Specific inhibitors of BRAF and MEK have shown significant survival benefits in large phase III trials. However, the prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations outside of clinical trials remains unclear. The mutational status of BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exon 2 and 3) was determined in melanoma samples of 217 patients with pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. The genotypes were correlated with clinical outcomes and pathologic features of the primary tumors. Time to disease progression was calculated with the cumulative incidence function. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Relative survival was calculated with the Ederer-II method. Treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was allowed. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were identified in 40.1 and 24.4% of cases, respectively. Concurrent mutations in both genes were detected in further?2.3%. The remaining 33.2% were wild type for the investigated exons (WT). BRAF mutations were significantly associated with younger age at first diagnosis (p?<?0.001) and truncal localization of the culprit primary (p?=?0.002). The nodular subtype was most common in the NRAS cohort. In addition, NRAS-mutant melanoma patients showed a higher frequency of nodal relapse (p?=?0.013) and development of metastatic disease (p?=?0.021). The time to loco-regional nodal relapse was shortest in NRAS-mutant melanoma (p?=?0.002). Presence of NRAS mutation was an independent risk factor for disease progression in multivariate analysis (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.02?-?3.98). BRAF-mutant melanoma patients showed a tendency for better overall and relative survival. Genotype was not a consistent risk factor in multivariate analysis. Instead, positive sentinel lymph node status (HR 2.65; 95% CI 1.15?-?6.10) and treatment with ICB in stage IV disease (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.48) were significant multivariate risk factors.

Multiple prevalence studies were gathered from the literature for comparison, reporting the prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the general US population and/or elderly US population. Of the 265 patients diagnosed with SCC of the skin, 61 (23%) of patients were found to have a preceding diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The prevalence of hypothyroidism among the population of SCC patients was significantly greater than the prevalence of hypothyroidism (overt and subclinical) in any general and/or elderly US population reported.

In this study, we examine the concordance in diagnoses made on 40 digital slides (DSs) vs traditional GSs in differentiating between spongiotic dermatitis (SD) and patch/plaque-stage mycosis fungoides (MF). Greater interobserver concordance rate in final diagnosis of SD vs MF was observed with the utilization of DS (86.7%) compared with the utilization of GS (80%). Intraobserver concordance rate between the diagnoses rendered by a particular dermatopathologist on GS and DS was 86.7%. For all histopathological criteria, a correlation in the magnitudes of interobserver vs intraobserver discordances suggests that discordance between glass vs digital evaluation of these criteria may be largely expected subjective read variation independent of the media. Discordance in identification of histopathological features did not have a statistically significant link to discordance in diagnosis for 7 out of the 8 features. The similarity between interobserver and intraobserver discordances suggests that WSI does not introduce additional barriers or variability to accurately identify histopathologic feature and to discriminate between MF and SD beyond interobserver variability.",skin_neoplasms

Nine of the 10 patients who were identified in the outpatient dermatology setting were found to have MBAITs on clinical examination. Forty of 53 patients (75%) identified in the literature review who underwent total-body skin examinations (TBSE) were found to have MBAITs, suggesting a high penetrance in patients who have undergone TBSE. The most prevalent malignancies among BAP1 mutation carriers were uveal melanoma (n?=? 60 [28%]), mesothelioma (n?=?48 [22%]), cutaneous melanoma (n?=?38 [18%]), and renal cell carcinoma (n?=?20 [9%]). A total of 71 unique mutations in BAP1 have been reported. Our results indicate that germline mutations in both coding and noncoding regions throughout the BAP1 gene can impair protein function, leading to an increased risk for several associated malignancies. Four of the 8 probands we present had no history of BAP1-associated malignancies and were assessed for germline mutations when found to have MBAITs on dermatologic examination. Dermatologists can identify patients with a high likelihood of the BAP1 cancer syndrome through personal and family history and TBSE for the presence of possible MBAITs.",skin_neoplasms

Patients undergoing head and neck surgery with regional/free tissue transfer were enrolled. Preoperative pain and validated screens for symptoms (neuropathic pain, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia) were assessed. Postoperatively, patients completed a pain diary for 4 weeks. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. Seventy-eight percent had pain prior to surgery, and for 38%, the pain had neuropathic characteristics. Thirteen patients (48%) completed at least 2 weeks of the postoperative pain diary. Patients with moderate/severe preoperative pain report significantly greater pain scores postoperatively, though daily pain decreased at a similar linear rate for all patients. Patients with more severe preoperative pain consumed greater amounts of opioids postoperatively, and this correlated with daily postoperative pain scores. Patients who screened positive for neuropathic pain also reported worse postoperative pain. Longitudinal perioperative pain assessment in head and neck patients undergoing surgery suggests that patients with worse preoperative pain continue to endorse worse pain postoperatively and require more narcotics. Patients with preoperative neuropathic pain also report poor pain control postoperatively, suggesting an opportunity to identify these patients and intervene with empiric neuropathic pain treatment.",skin_neoplasms

KIM increases the accuracy of prostate radiation therapy treatments and allows for hypofractionation. However, an additional imaging dose is delivered to the patient. A standardized procedure to determine the imaging dose per frame delivered using KIM was developed and applied at four radiation therapy centers on three different types of linear accelerator. Dose per frame for kilovoltage imaging in fluoroscopy mode was measured in air at isocenter using an ion chamber. Beam quality and dose were determined for a Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator, a Varian Trilogy, four Varian Truebeams and one Elekta Synergy at four different radiation therapy centers. The imaging parameters used on the Varian machines were 125?kV, 80?mA, and 13?ms. The Elekta machine was measured at 120?kV, 80?mA, and 12?ms.

Translationally controlled tumour protein overexpression was detected in several tumour types. Silencing TCTP was shown to induce tumour reversion. There is a reciprocal repression between TCTP and P53. Sertraline interacts with TCTP and decreases its cellular levels. We evaluate the role of TCTP in melanoma using sertraline and siRNA. Cell viability, migration, and clonogenicity were assessed in human and murine melanoma cells in vitro. Sertraline was evaluated in a murine melanoma model and was compared with dacarbazine, a major chemotherapeutic agent used in melanoma treatment. Inhibition of TCTP levels decreases melanoma cell viability, migration, clonogenicity, and in vivo tumour growth. Human melanoma cells treated with sertraline show diminished migration properties and capacity to form colonies. Sertraline was effective in inhibiting tumour growth in a murine melanoma model; its effect was stronger when compared with dacarbazine. Altogether, these results indicate that sertraline could be effective against melanoma and TCTP can be a target for melanoma therapy.",skin_neoplasms

Identifying patients at risk of amelanotic melanoma might enable earlier diagnosis and improved survival; however, the phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetics associated with amelanotic melanoma are unknown. To determine whether phenotypic characteristics, carriage of MC1R variants, and history of amelanotic melanoma are associated with histopathologically amelanotic melanoma. The Genes, Environment, and Melanoma (GEM) study is an international cohort study that enrolled patients with incident primary cutaneous melanomas from population-based and hospital-based cancer registries (1998 to 2003). The GEM participants included here were 2387 patients with data for phenotypes, MC1R genotype, and primary melanomas scored for histopathologic pigmentation. Of these 2387 patients with incident melanomas scored for pigmentation, 527 had prior primary melanomas also scored for pigmentation. Associations of phenotypic characteristics (freckles, nevi, phenotypic index) and MC1R status with incident amelanotic melanomas were evaluated using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, study center, and primary status (single or multiple primary melanoma); odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs are reported. Association of histopathologic pigmentation between incident and prior melanomas was analyzed using an exact logistic regression model. This study included 2387 patients (1065 women, 1322 men; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 58.3 [16.1] years) and 2917 primary melanomas. In a multivariable model including phenotypic characteristics, absence of back nevi, presence of many freckles, and a sun-sensitive phenotypic index were independently associated with amelanotic melanoma. Carriage of MC1R variants was associated with amelanotic melanoma but lost statistical significance in a model with phenotype. Further, patients with incident primary amelanotic melanomas were more likely to have had a prior primary amelanotic melanoma (OR, 4.62; 95% CI, 1.25-14.13) than those with incident primary pigmented melanomas. Absence of back nevi, presence of many freckles, a sun-sensitive phenotypic index, and prior amelanotic melanoma increase odds for development of amelanotic melanoma. An increased index of suspicion for melanoma in presenting nonpigmented lesions and more careful examination for signs of amelanotic melanoma during periodic skin examination in patients at increased odds of amelanotic melanoma might lead to earlier diagnosis and improved survival.",skin_neoplasms

For comparison, there were specimens from four patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and four patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis included stains for HE, cytokeratins (CKpan, Cam5.2), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), androgen receptor (AR441), perforin and adipophilin. SGC's were located in the upper (n?=?2) or lower (n?=?4) eyelid and were associated with various presenting clinical signs including chalazion-like lesions with pyogenic granuloma (n?=?1), papillomatous conjunctival tumors (n?=?3), a hyperkeratotic exophytic neoplasm (n?=?1) and an ulcerating crusted lesion resembling chronic blepharitis (n?=?1). The treatment was tumor resection, followed (if necessary) by adjuvant therapy with topical Mitomycin C (n?=?2). Histologic characteristics included basophilic pleomorphic cells with vacuolated cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, mitotic figures and in some cases pagetoid spread (n?=?2). CKpan, EMA and Cam5.2 showed strong positive immunoreactivity in all specimens (SGC, BCC, SCC). Perforin immunostaining showed a varying, but overall weak, non-specific cytoplasmatic staining reaction in all lesions. AR441 positivity was noted with variable intensity in almost all lesions and in particular in pagetoid spread in contrast to non-tumor cells. Adipophilin showed an annular staining of lipid granules in immature sebaceous cells in SGC in contrast to a more granular staining pattern in BCC and SCC. SGCs display a variety of clinical signs and may mimic many other lesions. Tumor resection, followed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis, leads to the diagnosis and initiation of the proper treatment regimen. Herein, immunohistochemistry showed an unequivocal profile in SGC and did not allow for an exact differentiation from BCC and SCC by immunohistochemical means only.

Clinical, radiological and pathological data were reviewed in 261 patients. Complete records were available for 11 patients developing local recurrence, including mode, time of presentation and size of the recurrent tumours. All mammograms before and after local recurrence were assessed in relation to a range of specific characteristics including parenchymal density, flap visibility, architectural distortion, mass, calcifications, fat necrosis, skin thickening and breast oedema. Twenty-one patients developed local recurrence at 10.4 years following reconstruction (mean age 49 years, resection weight 182?g and tumour size 33?mm). Following radiotherapy, 0.5% of patients developed local recurrence each year, which increased five-fold when radiotherapy was omitted (HR 4.99).

In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma. DETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374. Between May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7·7 months (95% CI 6·8-8·9) in the tremelimumab group and 7·3 months (5·9-8·7) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·92 [95% CI 0·76-1·12], p=0·41). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial",skin_neoplasms

Guidelines for SLNB have focused on pathologic factors, but patient factors, such as age, are not routinely considered. To identify indicators of lymph node (LN) metastasis in thin melanoma in a large, generalizable data set and to evaluate the association between patient age and LN positivity. A retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database, an oncology database representing patients from more than 1500 hospitals throughout the United States, was performed (2010-2013). Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2016, to January 15, 2017. A total of 8772 patients with clinical stage I 0.50 to 1.0 mm thin melanoma undergoing wide excision and surgical evaluation of regional LNs were included for study. The primary outcome of interest was presence of melanoma in a biopsied regional LN. Clinicopathologic factors associated with LN positivity were characterized, using logistic regression. Age was categorized as younger than 40 years, 40 to 64 years, and 65 years or older for multivariable analysis. Classification tree analysis was performed to identify high-risk groups for LN positivity. Among the study cohort (n?=?8772), 333 patients had nodal metastases, for an overall positivity rate of 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-4.2%). A total of 4087 (54.0%) patients were women. Median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-67) in patients with negative LNs and 52 years (IQR, 41-61) in those with positive LNs (P?<?.001). In multivariable analysis, younger age, female sex, thickness of 0.76 mm or larger, increasing Clark level, mitoses, ulceration, and lymphovascular invasion were independently associated with LN positivity. In decision tree analysis, patient age was identified as an important risk stratifier for LN metastases, after mitoses and thickness. Patients younger than 40 years with category T1b tumors 0.50 to 0.75 mm, who would generally not be recommended for SLNB, had an LN positivity rate of 5.6% (95% CI, 3.3%-8.6%); conversely, patients 65 years or older with T1b tumors 0.76 mm or larger, who would generally be recommended for SLNB, had an LN positivity rate of only 3.9% (95% CI, 2.7%-5.3%). Patient age is an important factor in estimating lymph node positivity in thin melanoma independent of traditional pathologic factors.

In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used for centuries to cure inflammation, edema, mastitis and hepatic cancer and in the Ayurvedic system of traditional medicine in India, S. nigrum is applied against enteric diseases, ulcer, diarrhea and skin diseases. A methanolic glycosidic extract fraction of unripe fruit of S. nigrum (SNME) was investigated for its anticancer property and possible mechanism to surmount adriamycin resistance in NCI/ADR-RES cells. The NCI/ADR-RES cells were treated with 7.8125, 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125 and 250 ¼g/ml of methanolic extract of S. nigrum (SNME) for 12, 24 and 48 h, to check the cell viability and proliferation. The cells were also exposed to adriamycin alone or in combination with SNME and the effects on cell growth were determined by MTT. Cell cycle analysis, Ethidium bromide and Acridine orange staining, Annexin-binding efficiency, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation of the apoptotic NCI/ADR-RES cells were also determined. To elucidate the relationship between SNME and multi drug resistance, we analyzed the expression levels of Mdr-1, JAK1, STAT3, and pSTAT3 in NCI/ADR-RES cells after treatment with SNME. Results from the cytotoxicity assay showed a direct correlation between the concentration of methanolic glycosidic extract fraction of S. nigrum (SNME) and the surviving cell population. Combination with Adriamycin, SNME exhibits a synergistic action on NCI/ADR-RES cells, giving the first line of evidence to overcoming Adriamycin resistance.

However, the evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) relies on histopathological measurements with limited accuracy and reproducibility. Here, we profiled DNA methylation markers to identify a methylation of TIL (MeTIL) signature that recapitulates TIL evaluations and their prognostic value for long-term outcomes in breast cancer (BC). MeTIL signature scores were correlated with clinical endpoints reflecting overall or disease-free survival and a pathologic complete response to preoperative anthracycline therapy in 3 BC cohorts from the Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels and in other cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The MeTIL signature measured TIL distributions in a sensitive manner and predicted survival and response to chemotherapy in BC better than did histopathological assessment of TILs or gene expression-based immune markers, respectively. The MeTIL signature also improved the prediction of survival in other malignancies, including melanoma and lung cancer. Furthermore, the MeTIL signature predicted differences in survival for malignancies in which TILs were not known to have a prognostic value. Finally, we showed that MeTIL markers can be determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing of small amounts of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, supporting clinical applications for this methodology.

Requisitions for chest CTs performed at our adult tertiary care hospital during April 2012 were compared to a cancer history questionnaire, administered to patients at the time of CT scan. Patients were excluded from the study if the patient questionnaire was incomplete or if the purpose of the CT was for cancer staging or cancer follow-up.

We found 44% (95% confidence interval [0.32-0.57]) of the chest CT requisitions for these 68 patients did not include the patient's history of cancer. Of the malignancies that were identified by patient questionnaire but omitted from the clinical history provided on the requisitions, 47% were malignancies that commonly metastasize to the lung.

To determine an as efficient cutaneous melanoma metastasis predictor as possible, Shields et?al. created a new prognostic index. This study aimed to examine whether the lymphatic invasion analysis and the Shields index calculation can be used in predicting lymph node status in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Lymphatic invasion of 100 melanoma specimens was detected by dual immunohistochemistry staining for the lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 and melanoma cell S-100 protein. The Shields index was calculated as a logarithm by multiplying the melanoma thickness, square of peritumoural lymphatic vessel density and the number ""2"" for the present lymphatic invasion. No statistically significant difference was observed between lymph node metastatic and nonmetastatic melanomas regarding the lymphatic invasion. Metastatic melanomas showed a significantly higher Shields index value than nonmetastatic melanomas (p?=?0.00). Area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) proved that the Shields index (AUC?=?0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.93, p?=?0.00) was the most accurate predictor of lymph node status, followed by the melanoma thickness (AUC?=?0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.86, p?=?0.00) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging (AUC?=?0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85, p?=?0.00), while lymphatic invasion was not successful in predicting (AUC?=?0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.67, p?=?0.31).

Because histopathologic findings can vary in women with multiple SCC lesions, from keratoacanthoma-like to well-differentiated SCC, we hypothesized that TP53 variants might shed light on the appropriate classification. We sequenced TP53 in 30 SCCs from 6 women who had multiple SCCs on their legs during a 21-month time frame. Histopathologic analysis showed 16 of the 30 lesions did not have prominent cytologic atypia and were distinguished by having expanded follicle-like structures composed of large, glassy, eosinophilic keratinocytes; these lesions resembled keratoacanthoma and were categorized as keratoacanthoma-like squamous proliferations (KASPs). The 14 remaining tumors had more prominent cytologic atypia and remained classified as SCC. Twenty of 30 tumors (including the KASPs) from the 6 different patients lacked detectable TP53 mutations. Ten of the 14 tumors that remained classified as SCC had detectable TP53 mutations. This is a small series.

28708603,"The relatively new treatment modality electronic intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is gaining popularity, irradiation being obtained within a surgically produced cavity being delivered via a low-energy x-ray source and spherical applicators, primarily for early stage breast cancer. Due to the spatially dramatic dose-rate fall off with radial distance from the source and effects related to changes in the beam quality of the low keV photon spectra, dosimetric account of the Intrabeam system is rather complex. Skin dose monitoring in IORT is important due to the high dose prescription per treatment fraction. In this study, modeling of the x-ray source and related applicators were performed using the Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code. The dosimetric characteristics of the model were validated against measured data obtained using an ionization chamber and EBT3 film as dosimeters. By using a simulated breast phantom, absorbed doses to the skin for different combinations of applicator size (1.5-5?cm) and treatment depth (0.5-3?cm) were calculated. Simulation results showed overdosing of the skin (>30% of prescribed dose) at a treatment depth of 0.5?cm using applicator sizes larger than 1.5?cm. Skin doses were significantly increased with applicator size, insofar as delivering 12 Gy (60% of the prescribed dose) to skin for the largest sized applicator (5?cm diameter) and treatment depth of 0.5?cm. It is concluded that the recommended 0.5-1?cm distance between the skin and applicator surface does not guarantee skin safety and skin dose is generally more significant in cases with the larger applicators. ? Intrabeam x-ray source and spherical applicators were simulated and skin dose was calculated. ? Skin dose for constant skin to applicator distance strongly depends on applicator size. ?

The aim of this work is to describe a new model of economical sustainability of ipilimumab developed in an Italian reference center for melanoma treatment. This retrospective, observational, and monocentric study was carried out at the Veneto Institute of Oncology. Ipilimumab was administered to fifty-seven patients with advanced melanoma. Overall survival, progression free survival, and toxicity were evaluated. A local management procedure was evaluated together with the cost-saving strategies implemented by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). We demonstrated that the use of ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma in real practice had an efficacy and toxicity similar to that reported in the literature. In this scenario, our management model (centralization of compounding + drug-day) permitted savings up to the 11.1 percent of the gross cost for the drug (calculated assuming that no cost saving procedures were applied) while the policy of cost containment designed by AIFA produced an additional 6.2 percent of savings. In real practice conditions, the centralized administration of ipilimumab allows to replicate the results of clinical studies and in the meantime to contain the cost associated with this drug. The local strategy of management can be readily applied to most of the high cost drugs compounded in the hospital pharmacy. Impact of findings on practice: (i) We describe a new model of economic sustainability (drug-day, centralization of compounding, payback systems) of an expensive and innovative drug, ipilimumab, for treatment of melanoma within an Italian cancer center.

The small observed differences by HIV status in matching characteristics (ie, age and sex) resulted from the restriction of the original cohort to those with at least 1 NMSC. Compared with uninfected individuals, those with HIV infection with a recent biomarker of more severe immune deficiency (CD4 count <200 cells/mL) had a 44% increased risk of subsequent NMSC overall and a 222% increase risk of SCC in particular, suggesting that subsequent SCC risk is associated with immune dysfunction. HIV-infected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons were are at higher risk for subsequent new SCC but not BCC, with a dose-response relationship between risk and lower CD4 counts and higher VLs. Subsequent new primary SCCs had a strong association with lower CD4 and higher VL among HIV-infected persons, suggesting that immune dysfunction might contribute to increased SCC risk.

Glomus tumors of the kidney are rare tumors and only a few cases have been reported in the medical literature. An extensive search revealed a very limited number of primary renal glomus tumors. Although most of these cases were benign in nature, including a case with uncertain diagnosis of malignant potential, two were malignant. We present a unique case of a 57-year-old male patient with an incidentally discovered 2?cm left renal mass. Histopathology examination and immunohistochemical studies confirm the diagnosis of glomangioma (a form of glomus tumor). The patient was followed for one year after partial nephrectomy and showed a benign course without any evidence of local recurrence or metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 16th case of primary benign renal glomus tumors. Primary renal glomus tumors are rare and may mimic other mesenchymal renal neoplasms radiologically. Proper investigation (including histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical staining) of kidney tumors is essential to make the diagnosis of glomus tumors, which usually show a benign clinical course following resection.",skin_neoplasms

There are several existing interventions, such as electrodessication and curettage, excision, Mohs surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, and topical/oral treatments. Laser therapy has emerged as a new promising alternative that should be explored. To review the literature on the dermatological use of laser therapy in the treatment of skin cancer. A review of articles available on the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases until May 2017 yielded 24 and 6 studies, respectively, on laser therapy in the treatment of skin cancers, particularly melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The four laser subtypes included solid-state, diode, dye, and gas lasers.

We examined whether social networking site (SNS) usage, and the particular manner of this use, was associated with skin tone dissatisfaction, sun exposure and sun protection among Australian adolescents. We also explored sex differences in SNS usage related to tanning. A total of 1856 South Australian secondary school students completed the Australian School Students Alcohol and Drug 2014 survey. SNS usage related to tanning comprised posting pictures, posting text, viewing pictures, viewing text and liking or sharing posts. Adolescents spent 214.56 minutes, on average, per day using SNSs. Behaviours related to tanning that involved pictures (i.e. viewing pictures, posting pictures, and liking or sharing content) were significantly associated with more skin tone dissatisfaction, more sun exposure and less sun protection. Females performed all SNS-linked behaviours more frequently than did males, with the exception of posting text. Australian adolescents spend a considerable amount of time using SNSs, and their behaviours related to tanning on these SNSs are significantly associated with skin cancer risk factors.",skin_neoplasms

Phase I: Rochester Epidemiology Project records were used to identify (between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2013) patients with PD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with 3 matched controls per case. After review, JMP statistical software with logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk of preexisting melanoma in patients with PD vs controls. Phase II: All Rochester Epidemiology Project cases of melanoma were identified (between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2014), with 1 control per case. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the risk of developing PD after the index date in cases vs controls, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the 35-year cumulative risk of PD. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the risk of death from metastatic melanoma in patients with melanoma without PD compared with those with PD. Phase I: Patients with PD had a 3.8-fold increased likelihood of having preexisting melanoma as compared with controls (95% CI, 2.1-6.8; P<.001). Phase II: Patients with melanoma had a 4.2-fold increased risk of developing PD (95% CI, 2.0-8.8; P<.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an increased 35-year cumulative risk of PD in patients with melanoma (11.8%) compared with controls (2.6%) (P<.001). Patients with melanoma without PD had a 10.5-fold increased relative risk of death from metastatic melanoma compared with patients with melanoma with PD (95% CI, 1.5-72.2) (P=.02). There appears to be an association between melanoma and PD.

28684896,"Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is a widely accepted surgical technique for patients with early breast cancer. The technique improves cosmetic outcomes, but a decrease in nipple sensitivity has been observed with NSM because of the incision into the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy with skin lifting system (ENSMSLS) removes all breast tissue through the axillary incision used for the sentinel lymph node biopsy, to avoid incision around the NAC area. With only one incision, NAC sensitivity is less likely to be affected by this technique. We sought to investigate the effect of ENSMSLS on sensation in the NAC, compared with NSM. A single-institution retrospective review was performed from August 2014 through August 2015. Thirty patients who underwent NSM in the past 6 years were frequency matched for age and cancer stage with those who underwent ENSMSLS between 2014 and 2015. All patients were recalled and re-examined for the study. Patients from the ENSMSLS group were recalled twice at both 3 and 6 months after surgery. Matched control subjects who underwent NSM were examined when they were recalled. The sensations of pressure, temperature, and vibration were measured. Patients who underwent ENSMSLS were significantly less likely to have decreased or impaired sensations of pressure, temperature, and vibration compared those who had NSM. The improvement in preservation of sensations by the use of ENSMSLS was very impressive. ENSMSLS, which avoids incision around the NAC, significantly decreases the possibility of decline in NAC sensation.",skin_neoplasms

In total, 100 patients completed the survey (response?=?52%); median age was 60 years and 51% were female. Breslow tumor thickness was unknown by 34% and incorrectly indicated by 19%, for presence of ulceration this was 33% and 11%, for mitosis 65% and 14%, and for AJCC stage 52% and 23%, respectively. Only 5% correctly reproduced all four tumor characteristics. Orally delivered information regarding warning signs, severity, treatment possibilities, and importance of self-inspection was clearest for patients, compared to information in the melanoma brochure. According to 77% of patients, YouTube videos regarding self-inspection of the skin and regional lymph nodes had additional value. Altogether, 63% preferred receiving information in multiple ways; 92% orally by their physician, 62% through videos, and 43% through brochures.

To evaluate the application value of the flap in the reconstruction of buccal mucosa carcinoma defects. Twenty-three patients received PMF with MacFee incision to reconstruct buccal mucosa defects that were caused by the resection of precancer lesions and benign and malignant tumors from August 2012 to April 2015. When elevating the cervical skin from the platysma, most of the subcutaneous tissue was preserved on the muscle. The continuity of the facial vessels was retained. The external jugular vein was preserved on the reverse side of the platysma. Twenty-one flaps survived completely, whereas the other two flaps presented partial skin loss. Two patients showed disturbed wound healing in the neck. Secondary healing was achieved after attentive wound care. All patients were followed up from 11 to 43 months. The function of the recipient sites recovered well. Except for the two patients with large-area scarring in the neck, the remaining cases presented satisfactory neck contours. No relapses were observed during the follow-up period. Compared with the traditional PMF, the muscle pedicled PMF provides a larger skin paddle and presents a better aesthetic and functional effect. Thus, this approach is a novel and ideal option for the restoration of buccal mucosa defects.",skin_neoplasms

Furthermore, the size of skin lesions increases during life proportionally to skin growth and therefore early removal is of major importance. Selected local anaesthetics like prilocaine can cause methaemoglobinemia. However, in contrast to general anaesthesia, many other local anaesthetics do not bare any major risks for infants. In this retrospective study, we analysed infants aged less than 7?months receiving tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) followed by dermatosurgery at our department between 2005 and 2015. The analysis is mainly based on our records. Additional information for a subset of patients was gained by a postoperative survey. Ninety-two infants (39 male, 53 female) with a median age of 4.2?months (range: 1.5?months; 6.7?months) were included in this study. Additional postoperative information was available for 33 of the 92 studied patients (35%). 2 ). Primary defect closure was performed by intracutaneous (n?=?68) or extracutaneous (n?=?24) suture techniques. No side-effects of local anaesthesia were observed in any patient. Postoperative complications include pain (1/33; 3%), wound-healing disorder (1/33; 3%) and visible severe scarring (2/33; 6%).

The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) chemokine can also promote uptake and processing by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). On this basis, we designed a pilot study of percutaneous thermal ablation as a means to induce heat-shock protein vaccination plus GM-CSF to determine safety and preliminary antitumor activity of this combination. This study was designed to assess overall safety of percutaneous ablation combined with GM-CSF for unresectable, metastatic melanoma including uveal and mucosal types. All patients received heat-shock therapy (42°C for 30 minutes), then received one of three treatments: (a) intralesional GM-CSF (500 mcg standard dose); (b) radiofrequency ablation (RFA)	+	GM-CSF; or (c) cryoablation plus GM-CSF. The primary endpoint of the study was the induction of endogenous HSP70 and melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Nine patients (three per study arm) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed as specified per protocol. All patients developed progressive disease and went on to receive alternative therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2-17.2). The study was not powered to detect a difference in clinical outcome among treatment groups. Percutaneous thermal ablation plus GM-CSF was well tolerated, technically feasible, and demonstrated an acceptable adverse event profile comparable to conventional RFA and cryoablation.

We included 396 cases of BAMN: 335 adults and 61 children (376 acquired and 20 congenital lesions). Anatomic mapping revealed that the nonweight-bearing portion of the foot was the most common site in adults (120/335, 35.8%) and the forefoot the most common site in children (17/61, 27.9%) for BAMNs. The long axes of the BAMNs paralleled the dermatoglyphic lines on the palms and soles, as did most tissue sections. The lesion diameters were <5.7?mm in all acquired lesions. Histopathologically, we diagnosed 69?lentigo simplex, 201 junctional, 114 compound, 8 intradermal, and 4 blue nevi.

The imaging findings can be suggestive of a benign pituitary tumor, but metastasis can never be completely ruled out with noninvasive work-up. Appropriate diagnosis of sellar masses is critical, as the treatment paradigm might change in the presence of a pituitary metastasis. Definitive tissue diagnosis might prevent unnecessary radiotherapy to the skull base or the need for systemic treatment when benign pituitary disease is confirmed. A retrospective chart review from 2010 to 2015 of all patients with recently diagnosed cancer and undergoing surgery for sellar region masses was performed. There were 9 patients (3 female and 6 male) identified. Lung cancer was the primary condition in 4 patients; the remaining 5 patients had breast cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. On final pathology, the sellar mass was a benign pituitary adenoma in 5 patients, metastatic cancer in 3 patients, and a granular cell tumor in 1 patient.

Available data are conflicting about the effect of SLNB delay on patient survival. Our objective was to determine whether delay between initial diagnosis and SLNB affects outcomes in patients with cutaneous melanoma. We performed query and analysis of a large prospectively maintained database of patients with primary cutaneous melanomas undergoing SLNB. An independent dataset from MSLT-1 (Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-1) was used for validation. Primary outcomes included disease-free survival and melanoma-specific survival. Early and delayed SLNB were defined as less than 30 and 30 or more days from initial diagnosis, respectively. There were 2,483 patients that met inclusion criteria. Positive sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 17.4% (n?= 432). Among all patients, 42% had SLNB 30 or more days after diagnosis and 37% of positive sentinel lymph nodes were at 30 or more days. No differences in sex, anatomic site, or histopathologic features were identified between the 2 groups. There was no difference in melanoma-specific survival or disease-free survival between those undergoing early or delayed SLNB. Examination of MSLT-1 trial data similarly demonstrated no difference in survival outcomes. This, the largest study on this subject to date, found no adverse impact on long-term clinical outcomes of patients due to delay of SLNB beyond 30 days. The MSLT-1 data confirm this result.

A retrospective analysis was conducted identifying patients with postexcisional defects after skin cancer occurring in the lower eyelid, reconstructed in 1 stage. Appropriate demographic, pathological, preoperative, and postoperative clinical data and photo documentation were collected and analyzed. After excluding patients with partial thickness defects (n=5), a total of 13 patients with lower eyelid full-thickness defects were studied, including 9 women and 4 men with mean age 66.5 years (age range 53-79 years). The most common malignancy was basal cell carcinoma (n?=?11). In one of the patients 2 synchronous neoplasms were excised simultaneously from the same lower eyelid. The reconstruction was successfully performed in 1 stage in all the patients by recruiting the same eyelid tissue and/or temporal tissue. No additional surgery was needed at a minimal follow-up of 9 months. Local tissue flaps have proven to be a reliable option for a single-stage reconstruction of large full-thickness defects.

Costs were estimated for inpatient admissions, using State service statistics, and outpatient services based on attendance at three hospitals in 2012-13. Cost-effectiveness for prevention was estimated from 'observed vs expected' analysis, together with program expenditure data. Combining inpatient and outpatient costs, total annual costs for Victoria were $48 million to $56 million.

28655469,"Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is a novel vaccination strategy utilizing the skin associated lymphatic tissue to induce immune responses. TCI using a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope and the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod mounts strong CTL responses by activation and maturation of skin-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and their migration to lymph nodes. However, TCI based on the commercial formulation Aldara only induces transient CTL responses that needs further improvement for the induction of durable therapeutic immune responses. Therefore we aimed to develop a novel imiquimod solid nanoemulsion (IMI-Sol) for TCI with superior vaccination properties suited to induce high quality T cell responses for enhanced protection against infections. TCI was performed by applying a MHC class I or II restricted epitope along with IMI-Sol or Aldara (each containing 5% Imiquimod) on the shaved dorsum of C57BL/6, IL-1R, Myd88, Tlr7 or Ccr7 deficient mice. T cell responses as well as DC migration upon TCI were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine in vivo efficacy of TCI induced immune responses, CTL responses and frequency of peptide specific T cells were evaluated on day 8 or 35 post vaccination and protection in a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model was assessed. + T cell responses. The induction of T-cell responses induced by IMI-Sol TCI was dependent on the TLR7/MyD88 pathway and independent of IL-1R. IMI-Sol TCI activated skin-derived DCs in skin-draining lymph nodes more efficiently compared to Aldara leading to enhanced protection in a LCMV infection model. Our data demonstrate that IMI-Sol TCI can overcome current limitations of previous imiquimod based TCI approaches opening new perspectives for transcutaneous vaccination strategies and allowing the use of this enhanced cutaneous drug-delivery system to be tailored for the improved prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and cancers.",skin_neoplasms

One such example is programmed death marker-1 (PD-1), an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on activated and regulatory T-cells. PD-1 expression was reported in a few reports, but the expression profile of PD-1 and mycosis fungoides (MF) remains largely to be characterized. In this study, skin biopsies from 42 prelymphomatous T-cell dyscrasias (CLD), 9 Sezary's syndrome (SS), 103 MF, and 20 CD30+ lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) were examined for PD-1 expression using immunohistochemistry. PD-1 staining was observed amidst many neoplastic T-cells in 6/9(66.7%) and 62/103 (60.2%) cases of SS and MF respectively, while only 6/42 (14.3%) cases of CLD and 0/20 (0%) cases of CD30+ LPD (P<0.001). Three cases are from same patients representing different stages of disease evolution from CLD to MF and SS with a corresponding enrichment of PD-1 positivity. In all cases there was variable staining of PD-1 amidst macrophages. There was no correlation with disease progression among MF cases. Twenty cases of CD30+ LPD did not show any PD-1 positivity. PD-1 seems to correlate with disease progression in epitheliotropic T cell dyscrasias ranging from minimal staining in prelymphomatous dyscrasias to significant staining in MF, likely reflecting the effects of PD-1 on inhibiting tumor surveillance regulatory T cell populations. PD-1 was consistently expressed in MF while it was consistently negative in primary CD30+ LPD, suggesting the possibility of using PD-1 as a means of distinguishing CD30+ MF from primary cutaneous ALCL.",skin_neoplasms

However, lateral approaches to the spine are usually more technically demanding and require a certain amount of surgical expertise. In this report, we describe a simple and easy technique to obtain the lateral viewing angle to the ventral spinal pathology. The technique is demonstrated in a ventrally located meningioma at the C2 level. Axial magnetic resonance imaging showed a square posterior shift of the spinal cord with little lateral space, which necessitated a more lateral viewing angle than the conventional posterior approach. With the patient in a prone position, we made a horizontal skin incision at the level of C2 and unilaterally exposed the right side of the C1 and C2 laminae. We then made a small perpendicular incision on the medial portion of the paravertebral muscles, which we retracted longitudinally. This approach provided an unobstructed lateral view toward the spinal cord. Following a gross total removal of the tumor with minimal cord retraction, the patient made an uneventful recovery. Her preoperative neurologic symptoms completely resolved in 2 months. No significant muscle atrophy was observed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging at 3 months. There was no long-term complication related to the muscle incision at 1-year follow-up.

Among 10 patients, 5 male and 5 female, aged 23 to 71 years old (median = 36 years). 2 cases of myeloid sarcoma were secondary from chronic myeloid leukemia, and 1 cases of myeloid sarcoma occurred after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to acute myeloid leukemia, and the others lacked the anamnesis of malignancies. The neoplasms occurred at bone, brain, skin, breast, epididymis, uterine cervix, small intestine, ovary and lymph nodes. Microscopically, the tumor cells were round or oval, which infiltrated diffusely or arranged in single-file. The cytoplasm was scarce and immature eosinophils were scattered. The nuclei were round, oval or focally irregular, and the mitosis was visible. The neoplasms were positive for MPO, CD34, CD43, CD45, CD99 and CD117 by immunohistochemical staining. 4 patients progressed into acute myeloid leukemia from 2 to 10 months after the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. All of them achieved complete remission after inductive chemotherapy, but 3 patients relapsed from 3 to 12 months after remission and only survived for 14 to 23 months. 4 patients were treated by using chemotherapy before bone marrow abnormality, and with the disease-free survival for 1 to 48 months.

Axitinib is a potent antiangiogenic agent with main activity against VEGF receptors 1 to 3. To the authors' knowledge, its role in combination with TACE for the treatment of patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. A phase 2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01352728) was conducted to evaluate the combination treatment. Patients with inoperable HCC who were potential candidates for TACE initiated treatment with axitinib at a dose of 5 mg twice daily and were evaluated for the need for TACE every 8 weeks. Axitinib was withheld 24 hours before TACE, and resumed 24 hours afterward when fulfilling predefined criteria. Radiologic assessment was conducted every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate. A total of 50 patients were recruited from March 2011 to April 2014. The mean age of the patients was 61.8 years, and 46 patients (92%) had hepatitis B infection. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B/C percentage was 76% (38 cases)/24% (12 cases). The 2-year OS rate was 43.7%, and the median OS was 18.8 months in the intention-to-treat population. Among the evaluable population (44 patients), 40.9% (18 patients) and 27.3% (12 patients) achieved complete and partial responses, respectively. Common grade 3 or above axitinib-related complications included hand-foot skin reaction (14%) and hypertension (24%). The presence of hypertension during treatment was found to be an independent prognosticator (hazard ratio, 0.563; P = .0073) suggestive of a contributory role of axitinib to efficacy.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the principal risk factor for CM, but is also the main source of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which has been associated with reduced risk and better prognosis of some cancer types. However, both low and high 25(OH)D levels have been associated with increased risk of CM. Obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) is associated with risk of several cancers and has also been suggested as a risk factor for CM, and may also be related to insufficient 25(OH)D and/or high leptin levels. Moreover, contracting a CM diagnosis has been associated with increased risk of developing second cancer. We aim to study whether low prediagnostic serum levels of 25(OH)D, high prediagnostic levels of BMI and high serum leptin levels influence CM incidence, Breslow thickness and CM mortality, and risk of second cancer and survival after a CM diagnosis.

Twenty seven men completed the study with a mean age of 61?years (SD?=?8.0; range?=?44-77?years). Nine partners also participated. The majority of men (92.6%) had surgery. The average time from treatment to the interview was 23.5?months (SD?=?11.7). Themes were frustration with sexual dysfunction, importance of support and understanding from others, depression and anxiety related to sexual dysfunction, importance of intimacy with partner, factors that impact treatment satisfaction, and education and comprehensive information about sex. Prostate cancer survivors and partners need accurate information about sexual side effects before during and after treatment. Men and partners required individualized help and guidance to manage sexual dysfunction. Support and understanding from partners, family, and others was also identified as an important aspect of healing and adjustment after prostate cancer treatment. Prostate cancer education/support groups played a key role in helping men and partners gain advocacy, education, and support. Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety need to be identified and addressed in men after prostate cancer treatment. Men and partners need assistance in understanding and navigating their way through intimacy to move forward with connectedness in their relationship. Satisfaction with treatment and with providers is dependent on patient education and understanding of all aspects of prostate cancer treatment including sexual side effects and incontinence.",skin_neoplasms

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with cT1-4 cN0-3?cM0 cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) (defined as tumors located below the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage, down to 22?cm from the incisors) treated between 2004 and 2013 with platin-based definitive CRT in four Swiss institutions. Acute and chronic toxicities were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (CTCAE-NCI v.4.0). Primary endpoint was loco-regional control (LRC). We also evaluated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates. The influence of patient- and treatment related features have been calculated using the Log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. We enrolled a total of 55 patients. Median time interval from diagnosis to CRT was 78?days (6-178 days). Median radiation dose was 56Gy (28-72Gy). Induction chemotherapy (ICHT) was delivered in 58% of patients. With a median follow up of 34?months (6-110months), actuarial 3-year LRC, DFS and OS were 52% (95% CI: 37-67%), 35% (95% CI: 22-50%) and 52% (95% CI: 37-67%), respectively. Acute toxicities (dysphagia, pain, skin-toxicity) ranged from grade 0 - 4 without significant dose-dependent differences. On univariable analyses, the only significant prognostic factor for LRC was the time interval?>?78?days from diagnosis to CRT. On multivariable analysis, total radiation dose >56Gy (p <0.006) and ICHT (p?<?0.004) were statistically significant positive predictive factors influencing DFS and OS. Definitive CRT is a reliable therapeutic option for proximal esophageal cancer, with acceptable treatment related toxicities. Higher doses and ICHT may improve OS and DFS and.

We analyzed a proportion of patients with multiple BCCs in the cohort of pathology report-confirmed cases of BCC and investigated clinicopathological differences between individuals suffering from multiple tumor lesions and patients with a single tumor. All consecutive patients with primary cutaneous BCCs, who were histologically diagnosed at our Department of Pathology during a 10-year period were enrolled into the study. A cohort of 899 participants with a total of 1,239 histologically proven primary BCCs were assessed. Of them, 728 (81%) had single BCC and 171 (19%) had multiple BCCs. Multiple lesions occurred more frequently in men than women. Mean number of tumors per patient was 1.5 in males and 1.2 in females. Among participants with multiple BCC manifestation, there was a steady increase of the male-to-female ratio with rising tumor number per individual. In the multiple BCC subgroup, the tumors were found more commonly in the trunk and upper limbs, and less frequently in the face. Histologically, these BCCs much more commonly included superficial subtype. There was a positive correlation between the non-aggressive histologic phenotype of BCC and multiple tumor presentations on the one hand, and the aggressive histologic phenotype of BCC and a single tumor occurrence on the other. Our analysis shows that clinicopathological features associated with multiple BCC manifestations include male gender, tumor location in the trunk and upper extremities, and superficial histological subtype. Focus on this risk profile may be beneficial for clinical screening and may help clinicians in the selection of individuals, who should be followed-up more closely.Key words: basal cell carcinoma - single and multiple manifestations - clinicopathological differences.",skin_neoplasms

The purpose of this study is to determine the cornerstones to perform this approach in a simple, safe, and effective way, so that it could be easily reproduced in other neurosurgical centers, particularly in those with modest resources. We reviewed and analyzed the surgical videos of 24 pineal region lesions that were operated on through an SCIT approach between June 2012 and October 2015. The SCIT approach may be divided into 3 main steps: 1) skin-muscle incision; 2) craniotomy; and 3) dura opening and access to the pineal region. Complete lesion removal was accomplished in 23 cases, and subtotal removal was accomplished in 1 case. The pineal region was effectively and safely reached through the SCIT approach in the sitting position with a mean time of 14 minutes, using a basic set of microsurgical instruments. Cornerstones and potential delaying events were carefully recorded for each of the 3 main steps of the approach. Moreover, we present in a short video a step-by-step guide to perform the SCIT approach in a fast and safe way. A correct application of microsurgical principles may allow to safely and rapidly perform the SCIT approach, therefore offering an effective and relatively atraumatic route for dealing with pineal region lesions.",skin_neoplasms

While novel therapies have demonstrated improved prognosis in clinical trials, few studies have examined the evolution of prognosis and toxicity of these drugs among an unselected population. We assess whether survival and toxicity reported in trials, which typically exclude most patients with brain metastases and poor performance status, are recapitulated within a commercial access population. 182 patients diagnosed with stage IV melanoma from July 2006 to December 2013 and treated with BRAF- and/or MEK-targeted therapy or ICI were prospectively studied. Outcomes and clinicopathologic differences between trial and commercial cohorts were assessed. Patients receiving commercial therapy (vs. on trial) had poorer prognostic features (i.e., brain metastases) and lower median overall survival (mOS) when assessed across all treatments (9.2 vs. 17.5 months, p = 0.0027). While toxicity within trial and commercial cohorts did not differ, patients who experienced toxicity had increased mOS (p < 0.001), irrespective of stratification by trial status or therapy. Metastatic melanoma patients receiving commercial treatment may represent a different clinical population with poor prognostic features compared to trial patients.

The final respondents were 823 patients (mean age: 65.3, standard deviation (SD) = 12.32). Fifty-two percent of the sample, and 79.4% of patients aged under 65 were employed. A total of 84.9% experienced changes in physical appearance, and the highest mean scores of psychological were observed for stoma (3.1) and skin eczema (2.9). A total of 66.4% reported no difference in daily life even after their physical appearance changed. However, patients younger than 65 years old who were employed experienced high social difficulties (12.5%). Many wanted to stop going to work and experienced severe distress in their social lives; 74.1% reported it is important to have the same physical appearance at work as before treatment. The majority of patients obtained information from doctors (35.2%) and consulted with their wife or partner (66.2%) regarding their appearance changes, and 5.7% did not have anyone to consult with.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel bra to aid in breast immobilization in the prone position. To assess the accuracy of prone position fixation of breast tumors, 33 breast cancer patients with 34 lesions were recruited. The bra used in this verification was customized from a commercially available bra. Duplicate MRI were acquired in the prone position, alternating with and without the bra, and for each series, patients were asked to step off the MRI table and re-set up in the prone position. Patients were also asked to remove and re-fit the bra for the second MRI. Each pair of images were superimposed to match the shape of the skin surface, and the maximum difference in tumor geometric center in three axes was measured. The required set up margin was calculated as: required margin = mean difference in geometric center + 2.5 standard deviation. The volumetric overlap of the tumor, as well as contouring uncertainties, was evaluated using contour analysis software. The median breast size was 498 cc. The required margins for the lateral, vertical, and longitudinal directions were estimated to be 4.1, 4.1, and 5.0 mm, respectively, with the bra, and 5.1, 6.9, and 6.7 mm, respectively, without the bra. These margins covered the dislocation of more than 33 lesions in total. With the bra, 33 lesions had achieved an objective overlap of 95% and 99% with 2 and 4 mm margins, respectively, whereas 4 and 8 mm, respectively, were needed without the bra.

28591550,"P120(ctn) is a specific membranous adhesion protein, that maintains the stability of intercellular junctions. An altered expression of p120(ctn), either reduced in the cell membrane or increase in the cytoplasm, plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. No research has analysed the expression of p120(ctn) in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin so far. Therefore, we immunohistochemically studied p120(ctn) in a set of cutaneous BCCs in order to determine, whether there is difference in the expression pattern related to the histologic subtypes and tumor growth characteristics. The study group consisted of 38 BCCs cathegorized into low-risk (non-infiltrative) subroup (8 superficial and 12 nodular subtypes) and high-risk (infiltrative) subgroup (10 nodular-infiltrative and 8 infiltrative subtypes). Specific monoclonal antibody against p120(ctn) was used for staining. Overall, there were 12 cases (31.6%) with normal preserved and 26 cases (68.4%) with abnormal p120(ctn) expression. In superficial, nodular, nodular-infiltrative and infiltrative subtypes, abnormal p120(ctn) immunoreactivity was found in 37.5% (3/8), 41.7% (5/12), 100% (10/10) and 100% (8/8), respectively. We have confirmed a strong correlation between the expression of p120(ctn) and both given, non-infiltrative and infiltrative BCC growth phenotypes. In the latter subgroup, almost all lesions showed diffusely reduced membranous staining, of which five also manifested an aberrant immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic positivity occurred solely at the invasive front of the infiltrative tumor formations. Our results showed that decreased membranous expression of p120(ctn) was a frequent event in human cutaneous BCC and it was associated with infiltrative growth phenotype. Considering that nearly half of the BCCs with non-infiltrative growth pattern also exhibited reduced membranous expression, aberrant cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of p120(ctn), which was found exclusively in the high-risk BCC variants, can more reliably reflect and predict biological behaviour and malignant potential.",skin_neoplasms

Facial BCCs excised from a single surgeon practice over a 2-year period were included in the study. Data pertaining to patient demographics, lesion depth of invasion, surface area, excision margins, perineural infiltration, location, previous history of recurrence, histological subtype and ulceration were extracted. A search of recurrence was conducted over the following 70-80 months. In total, 331 cases of facial BCC were included, and 10 lesions recurrences (3%) were identified within the observation period. Infiltrative (p?=?0.02) and micronodular (p?=?0.04) subtypes as well as incomplete or close (within 1?mm) peripheral (p?=?0.01) and deep excision margins (p?=?0.04) were significantly associated with tumour recurrence. Five of the 10 recurrent lesions had been re-excised for a recurrence previously, placing them at much greater risk of future recurrence (p?=?0.00). Incomplete and close excision margins, infiltrative and micronodular subtypes and previous excision are strong risk factors for facial BCC recurrence. Although depth of invasion, perineural infiltration, ulceration and surface area may indicate the aggressive nature of a lesion, the results suggest that with adequate excision margins, these factors may not influence the recurrence rate. The strongest risk factor was a lesion having already recurred after previous excision, and it suggested that these lesions be treated with particular caution and a closer follow-up regime be employed.",skin_neoplasms

Our aim was to assess the significance of PMRT in the modern treatment era for these patients. We have conducted the retrospective multicenter study and identified 658 patients with 1-3 positive ALN who were treated with mastectomy and ALN dissection between 1999 and 2012. Propensity score weighting was used to minimize the influence of confounding factors between the PMRT and no-PMRT groups. The variables including tumor size, lymph nodes status, skin and/or muscle invasion, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion and ER positivity which were statistically unbalanced between the groups were used to define the propensity scores. The median follow-up time was 7.3 years. In the modern era (2006-2012), no significant difference in locoregional recurrence (LRR)-free survival was noted between the PMRT and no-PMRT groups (P?=?0.3625). The 8-year LRR-free survival rates of the PMRT and no-PMRT groups were 98.2% and 95.3%, respectively. After matching patients by propensity scores, the PMRT group, compared to the no-PMRT group, exhibited significantly better locoregional control (P?=?0.0366) in the entire cohort. The 10-year LRR-free survival rates were 97.8% and 88.4% in the PMRT and no-PMRT groups, respectively. In contrast, no significant difference in LRR-free survival was noted between the PMRT and no-PMRT groups in the modern era (P?=?0.5298). The 8-year LRR-free survival rates of patients treated in the modern era were approximately the same between the groups (98.0% and 95.7% in the PMRT and no-PMRT groups, respectively). Particularly, LRR-free survival of HER2 positive breast cancer significantly improved in the modern treatment era, compared with that of the old treatment era (P?=?0.0349).

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are key players of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Fourteen paraffin-embedded tissue samples of MCC were stratified by their MCPyV detection. Apart from PD-L1 and PD-1, the TME was further characterized for the expression of CD33, FOXP3 and MxA. We observed PD-1 in 2 of 12 tumors. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells was found in 7 of 8 MCPyV(+) samples and was detected particularly in the periphery. The tumor cells were surrounded by a shield of PD-L1/CD33 immune cells. Expression of PD-L1 by the tumor cells was higher in areas with a denser immune infiltrate. CD33(+) cells without direct tumor contact were PD-L1 negative. Only a low number of FOXP3(+) regulatory T-cells was admixed. Tumor cells of MCPyV(-) samples were mostly PD-L1 negative. Our data demonstrate that PD-L1 expression occurs in tumor and immune cells, in areas in which they are close in contact. Interferon seems to play a role in this interaction. We postulate that PD-L1(+)/CD33(+) cells shield the tumor against attacking PD-1(+) immune cells. Therefore, next to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, blockade of CD33 seems to be a promising therapeutic approach.",skin_neoplasms

Intralymphatic metastases, often difficult to detect on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, are readily identified with dual immunohistochemistry for melanocytic and lymphatic markers. We used dual S100/D240 immunohistochemistry to detect LI in 125 melanomas from patients who underwent SLN biopsy and correlated LI with melanoma staging parameters and disease status. Dual immunohistochemistry allowed for the identification of LI in 33 cases (26%), compared to only 2% on H&E stained sections. Melanomas with LI showed greater thickness, higher mitotic rate and more frequent ulceration. Eleven of 33 cases with LI (33%) and 10 of 92 cases without LI (11%) were associated with a positive SLN (P?=?.006). More patients without LI were disease-free at last follow-up (80%) than patients with LI (50%; P?=?.002); LI was significantly associated with decreased progression-free survival.

Polarization-enhanced reflectance and fluorescence imaging (PERFI) is a new bedside method that uses fluorescent chromophores to image NMSC. While the feasibility of the technique has been successfully demonstrated in ex vivo studies, this is the first pilot study to extend the use of PERFI to in vivo intraoperative imaging of NMSC. Subjects were recruited from a population of patients with biopsy-confirmed NMSC, scheduled for Mohs micrographic surgery. Eight cases were studied. Sterile methylene blue (MB) was diluted in anaesthetic solution and infused into the peritumoral space. Digital photographs of the lesion were taken and Mohs surgery was performed. Then, the surgical bed was re-imaged. Each excision was also imaged ex vivo and processed for routine histopathology. Optical images were processed and compared with histopathology. The injection of MB was well tolerated. We observed a transient blue staining of the treated area, which disappeared completely within 1 week in all of the patients. In all subjects, the contrast agent, MB, was preferentially retained in the tumor. The ex vivo images correlated well with histopathology. In vivo images qualitatively delineated the tumor margins.

Overall complication rates were higher in the irradiated group (35.2 percent versus 14.4 percent; p < 0.01).

From years 1976 to 1984 to years 2000 to 2010, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence (cases per 100,000 person-years) of BCC increased from 222.0 (95% CI, 204.5-239.5) to 321.2 (95% CI, 310.3-332.2) and that of cSCC from 61.8 (95% CI, 52.3-71.4) to 162.5 (95% CI, 154.6-170.3). Over time, the anatomical distribution of BCC shifted from the head and neck to the torso and that of cSCC shifted from the head and neck to the extremities. The incidences of BCC and cSCC are increasing, with a disproportionate increase in cSCC relative to BCC. There is also a disproportionate increase in the incidence of both tumors in women, as well as a shift of anatomical distributions.",skin_neoplasms

Blood was collected 30 and 18 months prior to presentation with Sezary syndrome, at the time of presentation and during alemtuzumab. T-cell subsets in malignant (CD7-CD26-TCR-VBeta2+) and nonmalignant cells were quantified by flow cytometry. HIV-DNA in total CD4 T cells, in sorted malignant and nonmalignant CD4 T cells, was quantified by PCR and clonal expansion of HIV-DNA assessed by full-length next-generation sequencing. HIV-hepatitis B virus coinfection was diagnosed and antiretroviral therapy initiated 4 years prior to presentation with Sezary syndrome and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patient received alemtuzumab 10?mg three times per week for 4 weeks but died 6 weeks post alemtuzumab. HIV-DNA was detected in nonmalignant but not in malignant CD4 T cells, consistent with expansion of a noninfected CD4 T-cell clone. Full-length HIV-DNA sequencing demonstrated multiple defective viruses but no identical or expanded sequences. Alemtuzumab extensively depleted T cells, including more than 1?log reduction in total T cells and more than 3?log reduction in CD4 T cells. Finally, alemtuzumab decreased HIV-DNA in CD4 T cells by 57% but HIV-DNA remained detectable at low levels even after depletion of nearly all CD4 T cells. Alemtuzumab extensively depleted multiple T-cell subsets and decreased the frequency of but did not eliminate HIV-infected CD4 T cells. Studying the effects on HIV persistence following immune recovery in HIV-infected individuals who require alemtuzumab for malignancy or in animal studies may provide further insights into novel cure strategies.",skin_neoplasms

Furthermore, worsening of chronic skin disorders can be expected, as well as the development of treatment-induced and malignancy-related dermatoses. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and treatment of dermatological conditions in patients receiving hospital-based palliative care. Two hundred seventy-one palliative patients were enrolled. All assessments were conducted by dermatologists. Skin lesions were classified into seven categories: infections, skin tumors, dermatitis, chronic wounds, nail and hair disorders, pruritus, and other unclassified conditions. Treatment modalities were classified as topical only or systemic. Overall, 1,267 dermatological conditions were recorded, 49?% of which were hospital-acquired. All patients had at least one dermatological condition, and more than 50 different dermatological disorders were noted. The most common group of skin disorders was dermatitis (18.3?% of all dermatological conditions), followed by nail and hair disorders (17.5?%). Almost 16 % of dermatological conditions were treated systemically. Dermatological conditions are a common and clinically significant problem for palliative patients.

A retrospective, interventional series of 10 eyes with RB which underwent IAC using melphalan (5 mg/7.5 mg) and topotecan (1 mg), or melphalan (5 mg/7.5 mg) alone. Treatment outcomes were evaluated in terms of tumor control, vitreous seeds (VS) and subretinal seeds (SRS) control, and globe salvage rates. Ten eyes of 10 patients underwent 38 IAC sessions (mean = 3.8; median = 4; range = 3-5 sessions). Following IAC, complete regression of main tumor was seen in 9 eyes (90%) and partial regression in 1 (10%). All four eyes with SRS showed complete regression (100%). Of 5 eyes with VS, 3 eyes (60%) showed complete regression, 1 eye (20%) showed relapse, while 1 eye (20%) showed no response. Globe salvage was achieved in 8 of 10 eyes (80%). Complications included transient ophthalmic artery narrowing (n = 2), branched retinal vein occlusion (n = 1), forehead skin pigmentation (n = 1), and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 2). There was no case of stroke, hemiplegia, metastasis, or death. Transient hematological changes included relative pancytopenia (n = 4), relative leukopenia (n = 5), and relative thrombocytopenia (n = 4). Mean follow-up was 26 months (median = 28, range = 13-36) from the initiation of first IAC.

ORRs by investigator review were 45% (mBCC) and 60% (laBCC). Herein, we present long-term safety and final investigator-assessed efficacy results in patients with mBCC or laBCC. One hundred four patients with measurable advanced BCC received oral vismodegib 150?mg once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary end point was IRF-assessed ORR. Secondary end points included ORR, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and safety. At data cutoff (39?months after completion of accrual), 8 patients were receiving the study drug (69 patients in survival follow-up). Investigator-assessed ORR was 48.5% in the mBCC group (all partial responses) and 60.3% in the laBCC group (20 patients had complete response and 18 patients had partial response). ORRs were comparable across patient subgroups, including aggressive histologic subtypes (eg, infiltrative BCC). Median DOR was 14.8?months (mBCC) and 26.2?months (laBCC). Median OS was 33.4?months in the mBCC cohort and not estimable in the laBCC cohort. Adverse events remained consistent with clinical experience. Thirty-three deaths (31.7%) were reported; none were related to vismodegib.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of DEBDOX for the treatment of unresectable hepatic metastases from melanoma. A multicenter (University of Louisville, Thomas Jefferson University, MD Anderson Cancer Center), prospective, non-controlled treatment trial (NCT01010984) of hepatic-directed therapy with DEBDOX for the treatment of melanoma liver metastasis was reviewed. Primary endpoints were response rates by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, hepatic progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Twenty patients received a total of 61 DEBDOX treatments from January 2010 to March 2013. The median hepatic tumor burden was 40% (range 20-55), 18 patients (90%) had bilobar disease, and 13 patients (65%) had concomitant extrahepatic disease. At median assessment of 2.5?months, 11 patients (55%) exhibited a tumor response and 16 (80%) exhibited disease control. Median follow-up was 5?months (range 1.1-34.3?months). Median hepatic PFS was 3?months (95% CI 1.4, 3.4), and OS was 5?months (95% CI 3.3, 10.5).

All the consecutively reported AT cases were reviewed and reclassified as AT arising from sebaceous glands, hair follicles, or sweat glands. The concordance of clinical and histopathological diagnosis was also assessed. Most of the ATs were benign (24/25) with head and neck being the most common location (72%). Nearly 56% of the tumors exhibited sweat gland differentiation, 28% hair follicle differentiation, and sebaceous gland tumors accounted for 16%. The most common varieties of tumors encountered in the present study included hidradenoma papilliferum and pilomatricoma. The concordance between clinical and histopathological diagnosis was found to be 50% approximately. ATs of the skin are rare neoplasms with benign tumors being far more common.

28499369,"Renal cell carcinoma is among the most prevalent malignancies. It is generally sporadic. However, genetic studies of rare familial forms have led to the identification of mutations in causative genes such as VHL and FLCN. Mutations in the FLCN gene are the cause of Birt-Hogg-Dub? syndrome, a rare tumor syndrome which is characterized by the combination of renal cell carcinoma, pneumothorax and skin tumors. Using Sanger sequencing we identify a heterozygous splice-site mutation in FLCN in lymphocyte DNA of a patient suffering from renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, both tumor DNA and DNA from a metastasis are analyzed regarding this mutation. The pathogenic effect of the sequence alteration is confirmed by minigene assays and the biochemical consequences on the protein are examined using TALEN-mediated transgenesis in cultured cells. Here we describe an FLCN mutation in a 55-year-old patient who presented himself with progressive weight loss, bilateral kidney cysts and renal tumors. He and members of his family had a history of recurrent pneumothorax during the last few decades. Histology after tumor nephrectomy showed a mixed kidney cancer consisting of elements of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and dedifferentiated small cell carcinoma component. Subsequent FLCN sequencing identified an intronic c.1177-5_-3delCTC alteration that most likely affected the correct splicing of exon 11 of the FLCN gene. We demonstrate skipping of exon 11 to be the consequence of this mutation leading to a shift in the reading frame and the insertion of a premature stop codon. Interestingly, the truncated protein was still expressed both in cell culture and in tumor tissue, though it was strongly destabilized and its subcellular localization differed from wild-type FLCN. Both, altered protein stability and subcellular localization could be partly reversed by blocking proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Identification of disease-causing mutations in BHD syndrome requires the analysis of intronic sequences. However, biochemical validation of the consecutive alterations of the resulting protein is especially important in these cases. Functional characterization of the disease-causing mutations in BHD syndrome may guide further research for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",skin_neoplasms

Therefore, aggressive treatments such as laser irradiation and corticosteroid have been used; however, recently, the effect of propranolol has been widely noticed. In this study, the authors applied propranolol to low-birth-weight infants with IHs and evaluated its effect. Four low-birth-weight infants having IH were selected, with birth weights ranging from 582 to 814?g (average 703?g). The administration of propranolol was started within 4 days of hospitalization. The dosage of propranolol was increased from 0.5 to 2.0?mg/kg/day step by step. Vital signs and blood sugar level were checked prior to every administration of the drug. Continuous monitoring of electrocardiography and arterial oxygen saturation were performed during entire hospitalization.The outcomes were assessed by the patient's family and 2 board-certified plastic surgeons based on 5 parameters pertaining to clinical findings, using a scale of 1 to 10. Reduction rate of the hemangioma was calculated at the end of treatment and compared with the size prior to treatment. The authors could administrate propranolol without any severe side effects in all patients. Infantile hemangiomas gradually shrank soon after the authors started the treatment. Reduction ratios were 22.1% to 100% (average 48.72%), and the comprehensive evaluation of treatment was 7.5 to 10 (average 8.55) on a 10-point scale. With careful monitoring of their vital signs, propranolol could be a good treatment option even for IH in low-birth-weight infants whose birth weights were less than 1000 g.",skin_neoplasms
28466645,"To explore the trade-off between dose assessment and imaging dose in respiratory gating with radiographic fluoroscopic imaging, we evaluated the relationship between dose assessment and fluoroscopic imaging dose in various gating windows, retrospectively. Four-dimensional (4D) CT images acquired for 10 patients with lung and liver tumours were used for 4D treatment planning for scanned carbon ion beam. Imaging dose from two oblique directions was calculated by the number of images multiplied by the air kerma per image. Necessary beam-on time was calculated from the treatment log file. Accumulated dose distribution was calculated. The gating window was defined as tumour position not respiratory phase and changed from 0-100% duty cycle on 4DCT. These metrics were individually evaluated for every case. 10-liver values for 50%- and 30%-duty cycles were 9.4% and 12.8% of those for 100%-duty cycle, respectively. Maximum doses (cord/oesophagus) for 50%- and 30%-duty cycles also decreased 17.2%/19.3% and 24.6%/29.8% to those for 100%-duty cycle, respectively. Total imaging doses increased 43.5% and 115.8% for 50%- and 30%-duty cycles to that for the 100%-duty cycle. When normal tissue doses are below the tolerance level, the gating window should be expanded to minimize imaging dose and treatment time.

This was a retrospective study of male patients submitted to kidney transplantation in our center from 1980 to 2016 evaluating incidence, treatment, and follow-up of Pca in our population. In 1805 patients undergoing kidney transplantation, 20 men were diagnosed with Pca, leading to an incidence of 1.1%. Median age at renal transplantation was 53.4 years with a median age at diagnosis of Pca of 61.2 years. Initial median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 6 ng/mL and Gleason score was 7 (3?+ 4) in about 50% of cases. Bone metastasis developed in 10% and no visceral metastases were diagnosed. The majority of patients were submitted to radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Some other cancers occurred in these patients such as skin and pulmonary cancers. In 35% of the cases, the graft was lost. The main cause of patient death was cardiovascular. The mean graft survival was about 14 years.

Conflicting public health messages may confuse patients with skin cancer prone to further skin cancer. To explore the knowledge, behaviour and attitudes of patients with skin cancer to sunlight exposure and VitD sources. Patients (n = 10) previously treated for multiple basal cell cancer in a hospital setting participated in focus group sessions with semi-structured discussions to explore: knowledge of VitD, sun-avoidance behaviour and attitude towards sunlight exposure messages. Thematic data analysis was performed using software programme MAXQDA11. Pre-existing knowledge of VitD was low. Most patients practised sun avoidance and were not inclined to increase exposure. Patients did not perceive VitD deficiency as a substantial risk to their own health, or a need to take VitD supplements. They aimed to increase VitD status through dietary intake, but knowledge of food VitD content was lacking. The patients with skin cancer, appropriate to their heightened skin cancer risk, appeared unlikely to increase their sun exposure to gain VitD. However, education is required regarding the generally low levels of VitD in foodstuffs, and the requirement for supplements/fortified foods if strict sun avoidance is employed.",skin_neoplasms

However, the utility of this test in biopsy decisions made by dermatologists has not been evaluated. To determine the utility of the pigmented lesion assay (PLA) for LINC00518/PRAME expression in decisions to biopsy a series of pigmented skin lesions. In this secure web-based, multiple-reader-multiple-case study, 45 board-certified dermatologists each evaluated 60 clinical and dermoscopic images of clinically atypical pigmented lesions, first without and then with PLA gene expression information and were asked whether the lesions should be biopsied. Data were collected from March 24, 2014, through November 13, 2015. Participants were given a report for each lesion, which included the results of an assay for expression of LINC00518/PRAME and a PLA score with data on the predictive values of the information provided. Biopsy sensitivity and specificity with vs without PLA data. Forty-five dermatologists (29 male and 16 female) performed the evaluation. After incorporating the PLA into their decision as to whether to biopsy a pigmented lesion suggestive of melanoma, dermatologists improved their mean biopsy sensitivity from 95.0% to 98.6% (P?=?.01); specificity increased from 32.1% to 56.9% (P?<?.001) with PLA data. The noninvasive PLA enables dermatologists to significantly improve biopsy specificity while maintaining or improving sensitivity.

We analysed the demographics, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and microscopic findings on the skin biopsies, and evaluated the therapeutic outcome. Thirty-one patients (16 men and 15 women, mean age 37.8) were included from 9 cities, mainly from Helsinki. Fifty-two percent (16/31) presented with an allergic tattoo reaction mainly against the red colour (75%, 12/16). Reactions were clinically polymorph ranging from scattered papules or nodules to complete infiltration of a colour. Lesions were itchy and sometimes painful. The reactions were lichenoid, granulomatous, pseudolymphomatous or less specific with a dermal lympho-histiocytic or plasmocytic infiltrate. Other diagnoses included tattoo blow-out (13%), melanoma within a tattoo, naevi within a tattoo (10% each), lichen planus (6%), granulomatous reaction with uveitis, sarcoidosis and dermatofibroma (3% each). Allergic tattoo reactions were mainly treated with local corticosteroid (CS) ointments, CS infiltration or surgical removal.

According to the random number table method, 70 patients were divided into three-stitch transverse colostomy group(observation group, n=35) and traditional transverse colostomy group(control group, n=35). Procedure of three-stitch preventive transverse colostomy was as follows: firstly, at the upper 1/3 incision 0.5-1.0 cm distance from the skin, 7# silk was used to suture from outside to inside, then the needle belt line went through the transverse edge of the mesangial avascular zone. At the lower 1/3 incision 0.5-1.0 cm distance from the skin, 7# silk was used to suture from inside to outside, then silk went through the transverse edge of the mesangial avascular zone again and was ligatured. Finally, in the upper and lower ends of the stoma, 7# silk was used to suture and fix transverse seromuscular layer and the skin. The operation time and morbidity of postoperative complications associated with colostomy were compared between two groups. There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups(all P>0.05). The operative time of observation group was shorter than that of control group [(3.2¡¾1.3) min vs. (15.5¡¾3.4) min, P<0.05].

We aim to investigate whether immunohistochemical detection of BRAF mutation is a suitable alternative to molecular testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We assessed the incidence of BRAF mutation in our cohort of 132 patients, as determined by PCR, as well as examining clinical and histopathological features. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-BRAF V600E VE1 clone antibody in detecting the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in 122 cases deemed suitable for testing. The incidence of BRAF mutation in our cohort was 28.8% (38/132). Patients with the BRAF mutation were found to be significantly younger at age of diagnosis. BRAF-mutated melanomas tended to be thinner and more mitotically active. The antibody showed a sensitivity of 86.1% with a specificity of 96.9%. The positive predictive value was 96.9%; the negative predictive value was 94.4%. The concordance rate between PCR and immunohistochemical BRAF status was 95.1% (116/122). The rate of BRAF mutation in our cohort (28.8%) was lower than international published rates of 40%-60%. This may reflect ethnic or geographic differences within population cohorts.

In multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis, minority race/ethnicity, and metastatic disease at diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Ten-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 40.1%, with eight late relapses occurring at a median of 6.3 years after diagnosis (range: 5-14). Seventeen patients developed subsequent neoplasms (treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia = 9; solid tumors = 6; nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC] = 4). Excluding NMSC and melanoma in situ, the cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms at 25 years was 15% (95% CI, 4.8-25.1%).

There is a high rate of regional metastases, but limited evidence of distant metastases or disease-related death. We sought to report our series of patients given a diagnosis of PEM at our institution and provide mutational analysis of genes commonly implicated in melanoma in 2 cases. The pathology database was queried for cases of PEM diagnosed at the University of Rochester. Charts were reviewed for follow-up information. Mutational analysis of melanoma-associated genes was performed on 2 cases. Nine cases of PEM were retrieved in a 10-year retrospective review. Five patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with 3 of 5 having a positive sentinel lymph node. All 9 patients are alive and disease-free with average follow-up of 38.75?months. Two tumors were tested for common melanoma-associated mutations, and were negative, except for a telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter deletion detected in 1 sample. The deletion has not been associated with melanoma, and therefore its biologic significance is unclear. Small sample size, retrospective nature, and single institution experience are limitations. PEM appears to have an indolent behavior. However, currently the evidence is too limited to provide insight into its true biologic potential.",skin_neoplasms

CM data and daily UV index (UVI) from 31 cancer registries were collected for association analysis. A second dataset from 42 US states was used for validation. There was no association between log-transformed female CM rates and levels of UVI, but there was a significant association between male rates and UVI and a significant association between overall rates and UVI. The 5-year age-specific rate-UVI association levels (represented by Pearson's coefficient ¥ñ) increased with age in men, but age-specific ¥ñ levels remained low and unchanged in women.

Emerging types of cancer treatments offer the possibility of being ""cured"" in that patients can become long-term survivors whose risk of death is the same as that of a disease-free person. Describing cured and noncured patients with one shared mean value may provide a biased assessment of a therapy with a cured proportion. The purpose of this article is to explain how to incorporate the heterogeneity from cured patients into health economic evaluation. We analyzed clinical trial data from patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab (Ipi; n = 137) versus glycoprotein 100 (gp100; n = 136) with statistical methodology for mixture cure models. Both cured and noncured patients were subject to background mortality not related to cancer. When ignoring cured proportions, we found that patients treated with Ipi had an estimated mean OS that was 8 months longer than that of patients treated with gp100. Cure model analysis showed that the cured proportion drove this difference, with 21% cured on Ipi versus 6% cured on gp100. The mean OS among the noncured cohort patients was 10 and 9 months with Ipi and gp100, respectively. The mean OS among cured patients was 26 years on both arms. When ignoring cured proportions, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $324,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (95% confidence interval $254,000-$600,000). With a mixture cure model, the ICER when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $113,000/QALY (95% confidence interval $101,000-$154,000). This analysis supports using cure modeling in health economic evaluation in advanced melanoma. When a proportion of patients may be long-term survivors, using cure models may reduce bias in OS estimates and provide more accurate estimates of health economic measures, including QALYs and ICERs.",skin_neoplasms
28407793,"Spitz nevi are uncommon melanocytic neoplasms found in children. Historically, the diagnosis and management of these tumors has lacked consensus among oncologists, pathologists, plastic surgeons, and dermatologists. Once interpreted and treated as a ""juvenile melanoma"", many have argued for the benignancy of such tumors in certain patient age groups, encouraging a conservative approach. The lack of consensus surrounding the diagnosis and perceived malignant potential of these tumors has led physicians to approach them on a case-by-case basis and institutional protocols. To date, no evidence-based management guideline exists. The objective of this systematic review is to both collect and appraise the evidence on the diagnosis and management of these tumors. A comprehensive electronic literature search will be conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to December 2016. Our search involved collaborating with a healthcare librarian to create a strategy for the OVID/MEDLINE databases. A search of electronic databases for oncology, pathology, plastic surgery, and dermatology abstracts will be performed. Key search terms will include, among several others, ""Spitz nevi,"" ""Spitzoid melanoma,"" ""juvenile tumor,"" and ""pediatric"". The language of publication will be restricted to English and French. Wherever data allows, meta-analyses will be used to assess differences between Spitz nevi and the tumor of comparison. Additionally, data extraction and summarization using tables will be performed. This review has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016034045).

In rare cases, the development of an additional cutaneous MCC tumor is clinically consistent with a second primary MCC tumor rather than a cutaneous metastasis, which has important treatment and prognostic implications. To evaluate genetic relatedness in 4 cases with the clinical diagnosis of multiple primary MCCs. In this case series, 7 cases of clinically designated multiple primary MCC were identified; 4 cases met inclusion criteria for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Mutations, copy number alterations, and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) sequence were analyzed and compared between clinically designated multiple primary tumors to characterize genetic relatedness and hence assess clonality. Patients with clinically designated multiple primary MCC were identified from the multidisciplinary MCC Program at the University of Michigan, a tertiary care center. Four cases of clinically designated multiple primary MCC were characterized by tumor sequencing and targeted MCPyV sequencing to distinguish independent primary tumors from related metastases. Overall, 4 patients in their 70s or 80s were included and analyzed. Cases 1 and 4 were verified as genetically distinct primary tumors and did not harbor similar copy number alterations or demonstrate significant mutational overlap. Cases 2 and 3 were designated as clonally related based on overlapping copy number alterations. In clonally related tumors, chromosomal copy number changes were more reliable than mutations for demonstrating clonality. Regardless of clonality, we found that MCPyV status was concordant for all tumor pairs and MCPyV positive tumors harbored predominatly subclonal mutations. Our findings suggest that patients with MCC may develop a second genetically distinct primary tumor; in this case, the subsequent tumor is likely to develop through similar mechanisms of pathogenesis, either MCPyV-mediated or ultraviolet light-mediated. Next-generation sequencing analysis of chromosomal copy number changes and mutations is useful in distinguishing multiple primary MCCs from progression of MCC clinically resembling multiple primaries, allowing appropriate staging of the patient.",skin_neoplasms

28399024,"Plantar melanoma tumors are traditionally treated with wide local excision based on depth of invasion, followed by delayed reconstruction once negative surgical margins are confirmed. However, delayed reconstruction requires care for an open wound, a prolonged treatment course, and the need for an additional surgery. Immediate reconstruction has been shown to be oncologically safe in head and neck melanoma, but little is described in the literature regarding immediate reconstruction in plantar melanoma. We present our experience with immediate reconstruction after wide local excision for lower extremity plantar melanomas. We performed a retrospective review of all patients with biopsy-proven plantar melanoma who underwent wide local excision followed by immediate reconstruction of any type between 1999 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco. Patient demographics, postoperative complications, reoperation rates, and oncologic outcomes were collected. Thirty-eight patients were identified, with a mean follow-up of 34 months. Skin grafts were the most common method of reconstruction, followed by primary closure, local flaps, and free flaps. Only 1 patient had a major complication, which was skin graft loss requiring reoperation. Eight patients had either local or distant recurrence (21%). Immediate reconstruction for plantar melanomas can be safely performed with recurrence rates comparable and in line with previously published studies of wide local excision for plantar melanoma.

Despite minor skin toxicity, the regimen was well tolerated until he developed hemolytic anemia, an autoimmune side effect of ipilimumab. The treatment was withdrawn and steroids were administered until the issue was resolved.

The aim of this study was to determine if this combination also improved the renal side effects of VMF. To investigate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), we conducted a retrospective observational monocentric study in Lyon Sud University Hospital in France. We included 38 patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated melanomas treated by VMF and CB between March 2015 and June 2016. According to the NCI-CTCAE classification, AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine exceeding the baseline concentration by 1.5-fold. Serum creatinine was measured before treatment, then on a monthly basis during treatment, and 1?month after treatment discontinuation. Patients were divided into two main groups: AKI-positive (AKI+) and AKI-negative (AKI-), and further subdivided into three groups according to AKI severity (stage 1-5). Of 38 patients, 29 (76%) were AKI-, and all 9 AKI+?patients (24%) were diagnosed within the first trimester of treatment.

Despite the theoretical benefits of bolus, the clinical implications of locoregional tumor control, cosmesis, and the incidence of radiodermatitis are less well characterized. We hypothesized that treatment in the presence or absence of bolus results in equivalent chest wall recurrence rates, but its presence results in more severe acute dermatologic toxicity. Locally advanced breast cancer patients undergoing chest wall radiation therapy were retrospectively reviewed from 2005 to 2015 (n = 106; 53 with bolus, 53 without). Outcomes including local failure, acute skin toxicity, and treatment interruptions were recorded. Median age was 59 years (range, 28-91) and median follow-up was 34 months. Histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (73%), invasive lobular carcinoma (20%), inflammatory (6%), and neuroendocrine (1%). Fifty-nine percent were T3/T4 primary tumors and 29.2% had clinical/pathologic skin involvement. Node-positive patients accounted for 80.2%. Chemotherapy was administered in 84.0%. All patients had 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and received a median dose of 61Gy (range, 50-63 Gy). Local failure was 6.6% (n = 7) overall, with 4 failures in the bolus group and 3 in the no bolus group. No pathological factors were associated with local failure. Acute grade 2 and 3 skin toxicities (37 vs 22) and treatment interruptions (20 vs 3) were more common in the bolus group (P < .05). Mean treatment interruption (14.5 vs 5 days) was longer for patients receiving bolus. Patients undergoing treatment interruption were more likely to fail locally than patients not requiring a treatment interruption (17.4% vs 3.6%, P = .0322).

The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR) after 2 cycles of treatment. Secondary end points were best overall disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), best response duration, progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity profile. Of the 14 enrolled patients, no complete response was obtained after 2 cycles of treatment, but 3 partial responses and 6 stable diseases were observed. ORR and DCR were 21.4 and 64.3%, respectively. Median OS and PFS were 9.25 and 2.65 months, respectively. Median PFS was longer with combined treatment compared with cetuximab monotherapy (9.03 vs. 3.55 months).

Podoplanin expression in peritumoral cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts also correlates with tumor progression in several cancers. However, podoplanin expression and its association with extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the presence of podoplanin expression in tumor cells or peritumoral basal keratinocytes correlated with aggressive behavior in patients with EMPD and investigated the mechanisms of podoplanin-mediated tumor invasion in this disorder. Skin samples of 37 patients with EMPD were investigated by immunohistochemical analysis. The functions of podoplanin in keratinocytes were examined in vitro by RT-PCR and with invadopodia gelatin-degradation assays using HaCaT cells. Podoplanin was not identified in tumor cells in all cases. Podoplanin expression in peritumoral basal keratinocytes was observed in 25 patients (67.6%). In in situ EMPD, 50% of cases (9 in 18) exhibited podoplanin-positive keratinocytes, whereas 84.2% (16 in 19) demonstrated positive staining in invasive EMPD (P<0.05). Podoplanin expression in peritumoral keratinocytes was also associated with tumor thickness (P<0.005). By immunohistochemical analysis, podoplanin-positive peritumoral keratinocytes were found to be negative for E-cadherin, one of the major adhesion molecules of keratinocytes, which might contribute to tumor invasion into the dermis through a crack in the basal cell layer induced by down-regulation of cell adhesion therein. We further found that podoplanin-positive keratinocytes exhibited invadopodia, which are thought to function in the migration of cancer cells through tissue barriers, indicating that podoplanin-positive peritumoral basal keratinocytes might assist tumor invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix. The presence of podoplanin expression in peritumoral keratinocytes correlates with aggressive behavior in EMPD and might therefore serve as a useful prognostic marker for patients with EMPD.",skin_neoplasms

One thousand six hundred twenty-five eligible patients with head and neck MCC were identified in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). Radiation dose was divided into 3 groups: 30 to <50 Gray (Gy), 50-55 Gy, and >55-70 Gy. Cox regression was used to compare overall survival (OS) between groups, accounting for age, sex, stage, surgery type, margin status, comorbidities, and use of chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 33.5 months, 3-year OS was 48.9%, 70.3%, and 58.7% for 30 to <50 Gy, 50-55 Gy, and >55-70 Gy, respectively (P < .001). Compared to 50-55 Gy, doses between 30 to <50 Gy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.99; P = .002) and >55-70 Gy (adjusted HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.0-1.46; P = .06) were associated with worse survival.

Comparative data can highlight these differences and lead to focused efforts to reduce the burden of melanoma. To assess global, regional and national melanoma incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. Vital registration system and cancer registry data were used for melanoma mortality modelling. Incidence and prevalence were estimated using separately modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Total prevalence was divided into four disease phases and multiplied by disability weights to generate years lived with disability (YLDs). Deaths in each age group were multiplied by the reference life expectancy to generate years of life lost (YLLs). YLDs and YLLs were added to estimate DALYs. The five world regions with the greatest melanoma incidence, DALY and mortality rates were Australasia, North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Central Europe. With the exception of regions in sub-Saharan Africa, DALY and mortality rates were greater in men than in women. DALY rate by age was highest in those aged 75-79 years, 70-74 years and ¡Ã 80 years. The greatest burden from melanoma falls on Australasian, North American, European, elderly and male populations, which is consistent with previous investigations. These substantial disparities in melanoma burden worldwide highlight the need for aggressive prevention efforts.

The first effective systemic therapy in DFSP introduced into clinical practice was imatinib, demonstrating high activity in advanced cases. The aim of the study was to perform an analysis of patients with advanced DFSP treated with imatinib, with or without surgery, in routine clinical practice with long-term follow-up. We analyzed the data of 31 Caucasian patients (14 male, 17 female; median age 56 years) with locally advanced/initially inoperable and/or metastatic DFSP who started therapy with imatinib at initial dose 800?mg daily between 12/2004 and 07/2014. All diagnoses were confirmed cytogenetically for the presence of specific COL1A1-PDGFB fusion. Median follow-up time was 5.3 years. Metastases were present in 15 cases (8 - lungs, 5 - soft tissue, 2 - lymph nodes). Fibrosarcomatous transformation (FS-DFSP) was confirmed in 16 patients (52%). 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 58% (median 6.8 years), 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 64% (median time for OS was not reached). The shorter PFS and OS correlated with FS-DFSP and presence of metastatic disease. 5-year PFS rate was 93% for classic DFSP and 33% for FS-DFSP. The best overall responses were: 21 partial responses (68%, including 8 FS-DFSP, but the responses were shorter than for classic DFSP), 6 stable disease (19%) and 4 progressive diseases (13%). Thirteen patients (47%) underwent resection of residual disease and nine of them remained free of disease, although imatinib was discontinued. Median survival after progression on imatinib was 19 months, and longer survival were observed only in cases were rescue surgery/radiotherapy was possible. Our results indicate the long-term activity of imatinib in therapy of inoperable and/or metastatic cases of DFSP, including FS-DFSP. Some DFSP patients initially evaluated as unresectable/metastatic or necessitating mutilating surgery turned resectable after imatinib therapy and this rational approach leading to complete remission maybe potentially curative.",skin_neoplasms

We sought to compare recurrence rates after different treatments in tumors judged appropriate for MMS. We used data from an observational prospective cohort study and retrospectively categorized consecutive tumors as appropriate for MMS according to the AUC. Among appropriate tumors, we used survival analyses to compare 5-year recurrence rates after treatments. Among tumors appropriate for MMS (N?=?1483), adjusted 5-year recurrence rates were 2.9% (range, 1.4-4.3%) after MMS, 5.5% (range, 3.1-7.9%) after excision, 4.0% (range, 0.6-7.2%) after destruction, and 5.9% (range, 1.5-10.2%) after other treatments. In tumors treated only with MMS or excision (the most similar subgroups), the adjusted hazard ratio of 5-year recurrence after MMS was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.0; P?=?.06). This study is limited by its uncertain generalizability, lack of randomization, and unmeasured characteristics.

The present study is focused on the development of a nano-liposome-based approach for the delivery of 2,6P-OLA on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced cutaneous papilloma in experimental mice. For effective and specific delivery of the conjugate to the tumor site, it was incorporated into escheriosome (EC); an Escherichia coli lipid nanoparticle. I determined the size, zeta-potential, entrapment and release efficacy of 2,6P-OLA-EC nano-formulation. The consequence of 2,6P-OLA-EC treatment was initially analyzed by regression in tumor volume, inhibition of cutaneous papilloma and survival of treated mice. Its anticancer activity was further examined by histopathology, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and electroblot-immuno assay of apoptotic factors. Distinct disperse circular shaped EC nanoparticles showed slow and sustained release of therapeutic concentration of 2,6P-OLA in the surrounding milieu. 2,6P-OLA-EC significantly reduced tumor volume and inhibited onset of new papilloma. Treatment with nano-formulation revealed induced caspase-9 activity and noteworthy apoptotic response as visualized by fluorescence microscopy and TUNEL assay. Electroblot-immuno analysis revealed significant modulation of p53wt and p53mut expression levels. The results suggest the therapeutic potential of 2,6P-OLA entrapped in nano-escheriosomes against cutaneous papilloma and can become a promising system against various forms of cancer as well.",skin_neoplasms

Gene analysis of two out of four induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones established from the patient unexpectedly revealed an additional mutation, c.274delT. Deep sequencing confirmed a low-prevalence somatic mutation (5.5%-15.6% depending on the tissue) identical to the one found in iPSC clones. This is the first case of mosaicism unequivocally demonstrated in NBCCS. Furthermore, the mosaicism is unique in that the patient carries one normal and two mutant alleles. Because these mutations are located in close proximity, reversion error is likely to be involved in this event rather than a spontaneous mutation. In addition, this study indicates that gene analysis of iPSC clones can contribute to the detection of mosaicism containing a minor population carrying a second mutation.",skin_neoplasms

Cells from the AML-infiltrated skin from an M6 patient were infected with a lentivirus carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC to induce iPSCs. The characteristics of the iPSCs were confirmed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining. The proliferation ability of iPSCs was detected with a CCK-8 assay. The expression of pluripotency markers was measured by immunostaining, and the expression of stem cell-related genes was detected by qRT-PCR; distortion during the induction process was detected by karyotype analysis; the differentiation potential of iPSCs was determined by embryoid body-formation and teratoma-formation assays. ALP staining confirmed that these cells exhibited positive staining and had the characteristics of iPSCs. The CCK-8 assay showed that the iPSCs had the ability to proliferate. Immunostaining demonstrated that iPSC clones showed positive expression of NANOG, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81. qRT-PCR results revealed that the mRNA expression of Nanog, Lin28, Cripto, FOX3, DNMT3b, DPPA2, and DPPA4 significantly increased in iPSCs. Karyotype analysis found no chromosome aberration in the iPSCs. The results of the embryoid body-formation and teratoma-formation assays indicated that the iPSCs had the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers.

However, little is known about the value of dermoscopy in recognizing these difficult-to-diagnose melanomas. To describe the dermoscopic features of SK-like melanomas to understand their clinical morphology. This observational retrospective study used 134 clinical and dermoscopic images of histopathologically proven melanomas in 134 patients treated in 9 skin cancer centers in Spain, France, Italy, and Austria. Without knowledge that the definite diagnosis for all the lesions was melanoma, 2 dermoscopy-trained observers evaluated the clinical descriptions and 48 dermoscopic features (including all melanocytic and nonmelanocytic criteria) of all 134 images and classified each dermoscopically as SK or not SK. The total dermoscopy score and the 7-point checklist score were assessed. Images of the lesions and patient data were collected from July 15, 2013, through July 31, 2014. Frequencies of specific morphologic patterns of (clinically and dermoscopically) SK-like melanomas, patient demographics, and interobserver agreement of criteria were evaluated. Of the 134 cases collected from 72 men and 61 women, all of whom were white and who had a mean (SD) age of 55.6 (17.5) years, 110 (82.1%) revealed dermoscopic features suggestive of melanoma, including pigment network (74 [55.2%]), blue-white veil (72 [53.7%]), globules and dots (68 [50.7%]), pseudopods or streaks (47 [35.1%]), and blue-black sign (43 [32.3%]). The remaining 24 cases (17.9%) were considered likely SKs, even by dermoscopy. Overall, lesions showed a scaly and hyperkeratotic surface (45 [33.6%]), yellowish keratin (42 [31.3%]), comedo-like openings (41 [30.5%]), and milia-like cysts (30 [22.4%]). The entire sample achieved a mean (SD) total dermoscopy score of 4.7 (1.6) and a 7-point checklist score of 4.4 (2.3), while dermoscopically SK-like melanomas achieved a total dermoscopy score of only 4.2 (1.3) and a 7-point checklist score of 2.0 (1.9), both in the range of benignity. The most helpful criteria in correctly diagnosing SK-like melanomas were the presence of blue-white veil, pseudopods or streaks, and pigment network. Multivariate analysis found only the blue-black sign to be significantly associated with a correct diagnosis, while hyperkeratosis and fissures and ridges were independent risk markers of dermoscopically SK-like melanomas. Seborrheic keratosis-like melanomas can be dermoscopically challenging, but the presence of the blue-black sign, pigment network, pseudopods or streaks, and/or blue-white veil, despite the presence of other SK features, allows the correct diagnosis of most of the difficult melanoma cases.",skin_neoplasms

Overall, 65 patients (49.2%) expressed awareness of their susceptibility to skin cancers. A high educational level was the main factor associated with patients' awareness. Thirty-six RTRs (27.3%) reported using sunscreen regularly. High educational level and awareness of personal susceptibility to NMSC development were the most relevant factors associated with sun protection habits. The present study showed the low level of sunscreen use among RTRs and their scanty awareness of personal skin cancer risk.

Twelve patients with the same expander model underwent 2-field IMPT as part of a prospective registry. All planning dosimetry was checked with an in-house graphic processing unit--based Monte Carlo simulation. Proton ranges through the expander were validated using a sample implant. Dosimetric impact of setup metallic port position uncertainty was evaluated. Pre- and posttreatment photographs were obtained and acute toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.

The chemotherapy group was subsequently stratified into 3 subgroups on the basis of the number of days between chemotherapy treatment and reconstructive surgery (d 30 days, 30-60 days, > 60 days) for further analysis. Patients who received chemotherapy were followed for an average of 803.4 days (26.4 months) from the time of initial reconstruction (mean time to complication, 43.3 ± 82.7 days), and experienced an overall greater complication rate compared with control subjects (32.8% vs. 24.4%; P?= .078). When complications were divided into minor, major, and reconstructive failure categories, analysis revealed that the chemotherapy group experienced more minor complications than the control group (18% vs. 11%; P?= .067). However, there were no statistically significant differences in major complication rates (10.5% vs. 9.4%) and reconstructive failure complication rates (3.8% vs. 2.4%) between the chemotherapy group and control group. Sixty-eight patients (19.8%) underwent surgery within 30 days of chemotherapy, 210 patients (61%) within 30 to 60 days, and 66 patients (19.2%) after 60 days.

In these patients, higher MR is associated with decreased survival. This study utilizes the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to evaluate MR reporting since AJCC7. The NCDB was queried for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma from 1998 to 2013. Because MR reporting was infrequent prior to implementing AJCC7, records from 2010 to 2013 were analyzed. Categorical variables were compared with chi-square tests; univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to determine the effects of covariates on MR reporting. A total of 107,134 patients met inclusion criteria. From 2010 to 2013, MR reporting increased dramatically (64.3-80.9%). On multivariate analysis, factors significantly related to increased MR reporting include later diagnosis year, T-classification (T1a and b vs. T1), facility type (academic vs. other specified types of cancer programs), facility volume, patient income, level of education, and county population (metropolitan vs. urban and rural). MR reporting increased dramatically after the introduction of AJCC7; however, disparities in reporting remain across facility types. Further investigation of procedures performed in academic settings that may influence reporting of MR is warranted. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:281-286. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",skin_neoplasms

Reconstructive failure exposes the airway and neck vessels to digestive contents. We performed a national N?=?near-all analysis of the administrative dataset to identify pharyngolaryngectomies in England between 2002 and 2012. Information about morbidity, pharyngeal closure method and post-operative complications was derived. There were 1589 predominantly male (78%) patients whose mean age at surgery was 62 years. The commonest morbidities were hypertension (24%) and ischemic heart disease (11%). For 232 (15%) patients, pharyngolaryngectomy was performed during an emergency admission. The pharynx was closed primarily in 551 patients, with skin or muscle free or pedicled flaps in 755 patients and with jejunum and gastric pull-up in 123 and 160 patients, respectively. In-hospital mortality rate was 6% and was significantly higher in the gastric pull-up group (11%). Reconstructive failure had an odds ratio of 6.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-16.1] for in-hospital death. The five-year survival was 57% and age, morbidities, emergency surgery, gastric pull-up, major acute cardiovascular events, renal failure and reconstructive failure independently worsened prognosis. Patients who underwent pharyngeal reconstruction with radial forearm or anterolateral thigh flaps had lower mortality rates than patients who had jejunum flap reconstruction (hazard ratio?=?1.50 [95% CI 1.03-2.19]) or gastric pull-up (hazard ratio?=?1.92 [95% CI 1.32-2.80]).

Its initially indolent clinical presentation explains the frequently late diagnosis that, together with its typically multifocal pattern and poor delimitation, often makes surgery difficult. The low incidence of primary cutaneous angiosarcoma means that few large single-center series have been published. We review the clinical and pathologic characteristics of cutaneous angiosarcomas treated in our hospital, looking for prognostic factors and for possible diagnostic traits that could facilitate early diagnosis. This was a retrospective observational study including all patients diagnosed with cutaneous angiosarcoma in Instituto Valenciano de Oncolog?a in Valencia, Spain between January 2000 and December 2015. We recorded 16 clinical parameters, including age, sex, type of angiosarcoma, site, size, and time since diagnosis, and 8 histopathologic parameters. We identified 16 patients (11 women and 5 men) with cutaneous angiosarcoma. Their mean age was 67 years (median, 71 years). The most common site was the trunk (10 cases), followed by the head and neck (5 cases). The mean size of the tumor was 10cm (median, 6.5cm). Fourteen patients underwent surgical excision. Six of the 16 patients were alive at the end of the study, after a mean follow-up period of 42.5 months.

Inclusion criteria were all articles written in English language that evaluated pre-, intra-, or postoperative ICG applications in surgical procedures usually performed by plastic surgeons. Case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and experimental studies on animals or cadavers were excluded after title and abstract screening. Of the 1389 article titles retrieved, 41 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. ICG applications in plastic surgery were ICG lymphangiography used in sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer and melanoma and in microsurgery for the staging and treatment of secondary chronic lymphedema. The latest updates of ICG angiography in assessing free flaps, pedicled flaps, or large skin paddles were also retrieved. Large prospective studies suggest that ICG lymphography could be used as a single tracer to reliably perform sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the case of cutaneous melanoma, ICG lymphography increases node detection sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with lymphoscintigraphy. In chronic lymphedema, it is useful for pre- and postoperative staging and intraoperative anatomical location of lymphatic pathways when lymphovenous bypass is indicated. ICG angiography is used intraoperatively to assess free flap anastomosis and design skin paddles and postoperatively to monitor buried flaps. In pedicled perforator flaps or for large skin paddles, intraoperative ICG angiography is strongly correlated with postoperative outcomes. 3.",skin_neoplasms

Being overweight was significantly associated with CM risk, and this relationship was highly age-conditioned; the second finding was the protective effect of oestrogen therapies for women. Both findings may have a significant impact on melanoma prevention, as the prevalence of obesity and hormone therapy use is increasing worldwide.",skin_neoplasms
28289050,"To explore whether knowledge about the harms of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) influences UK university students' sun-related behaviours and examine in depth their attitudes towards: sun protection, natural and artificial tanning behaviours. Qualitative methodology with 15 semistructured, individual interviews. Thematic analysis using the Framework Method with analyst triangulation and member validation. One university in the West Midlands, UK. 15 Caucasian male (n=4) and female (n=11) students, aged 18-22?years, from a UK university. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from the university's main campus followed by purposive sampling for: gender, course and sun-related behaviours. knowledge of UVR; (2) sun-protection practices; (3) attitudes towards tanning; (4) external influences and (5) internal influences. All students knew the associated skin cancer risks from the sun and sunbed use, but this did not appear an important influence in their sun-related behaviours. Body image strongly motivated sun-protection practices and the desire to tan naturally or artificially, across both genders. However, participants' final decision-making appeared to be influenced by their beliefs that practising known harmful sun-related behaviours would not affect them or the perceived susceptibility to sunburn. Beliefs about sunbathing and sunscreen use prompted improper use of sun protection and inadvertently caused more harmful practices. Participants' peers, family and the media had dual roles influencing the development of attitudes towards sun protection and tanning, which contributed to how participants behaved in the sun and their engagement in tanning methods. Knowledge about the risk of skin cancer associated with UVR did not strongly influence sun-related behaviours, whereas body image appeared as a key motivator. Attitudes towards sun protection and tanning stemmed from the media, peers and family, and particularly from childhood habits. Public health strategies may benefit from appearance-related skin cancer prevention campaigns, encouraging safer parental sun-related habits and correcting sun-related misconceptions.",skin_neoplasms
28287855,"Cataract and sun-related skin conditions are proxies to lifetime UV exposure. We examined the association between them using real-world data from an unselected Israeli population. Computerized data was obtained from an Israeli health maintenance organization regarding cases of sun-related skin pathologies and cataract diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 in 686,260 members aged 40 or above. Sun-related skin disorders were found in 9.3% of the study population, more commonly among the elderly, and those who reside in areas of higher socioeconomic status. Cataract was diagnosed in 13.1% of the study population, with highest prevalence (47%) among squamous cell carcinoma patients, who were the oldest group. Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, residential district, birth region, smoking, and chronic comorbidities showed no statistically significant association between melanoma and cataract (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.91-1.22). Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and actinic keratosis were associated with increased likelihood of prevalent cataract with adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of 1.14 (1.08-1.20), 1.11 (1.01-1.19), and 1.16 (1.13-1.19), respectively. When stratified by gender, the association between actinic keratosis and cataract was stronger in women than in men, particularly in patients under 65 years. The association between the prevalence of skin cancers and the prevalence of cataract enhances the conclusion that cataract is related to UVR exposure.",skin_neoplasms
28284760,"Clinical pathways are patient management plans that standardize evidence-based practices to ensure high-quality and cost-effective medical care. Implementation of a pathway is a collaborative process in our network, requiring the active involvement of physicians. This approach promotes acceptance of pathway recommendations, although a peer review process is necessary to ensure compliance and to capture and approve off-pathway selections. We investigated the peer review process and factors associated with time to completion of peer review. Our cancer center implemented radiation oncology pathways for every disease site throughout a large, integrated network. Recommendations are written based upon national guidelines, published literature, and institutional experience with evidence evaluated hierarchically in order of efficacy, toxicity, and then cost. Physicians enter decisions into an online, menu-driven decision support tool that integrates with medical records. Data were collected from the support tool and included the rate of on- and off-pathway selections, peer review decisions performed by disease site directors, and time to complete peer review. A total of 6965 treatment decisions were entered in 2015, and 605 (8.7%) were made off-pathway and were subject to peer review. The median time to peer review decision was 2 days (interquartile range, 0.2-6.8). Factors associated with time to peer review decision >48 hours on univariate analysis include disease site (P < .0001) with a trend toward significance (P = .066) for radiation therapy modality. There was no difference between recurrent and non-recurrent disease (P = .267). Multivariable analysis revealed disease site was associated with time to peer review (P < .001), with lymphoma and skin/sarcoma most strongly influencing decision time >48 hours. Clinical pathways are an integral tool for standardizing evidence-based care throughout our large, integrated network, with 91.3% of all treatment decisions being made as per pathway. The peer review process was feasible, with <1% selections ultimately rejected, suggesting that awareness of peer review of treatment decisions encourages compliance with clinical pathway recommendations.",skin_neoplasms

Pembrolizumab (2?mg/kg) was given every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 2 years or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. The tumor response was assessed as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) by both investigator review and central review. Forty-two patients with advanced melanoma received pembrolizumab. A primary cutaneous histology was observed in 34 patients (81.0%), while a primary mucosal histology was observed in 8 patients (19.0%). Thirty-four patients (81.0%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-related AEs were pruritus, maculopapular rash, malaise, and hypothyroidism. Grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs occurred in 8 patients (19.0%). The only grade 3-5 treatment-related AE reported in at least two patients was anemia. There were two treatment-related deaths (unknown cause and cerebral hemorrhage). Among the 37 evaluable patients, the confirmed overall response rates (ORRs) determined by central review were 24.1% (95% CI 10.3-43.5) for cutaneous melanoma and 25.0% (95% CI 3.2-65.1) for mucosal melanoma. The responses were durable, and the median duration of response was not reached in either population. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with a 12-month OS of 82.7% for cutaneous melanoma and 51.4% for mucosal melanoma. The safety profile of pembrolizumab in Japanese patients was similar to that reported in the previous clinical studies.

28281862,"Proton beam therapy represents a promising modality for left-side breast cancer (BC) treatment, but concerns have been raised about skin toxicity and poor cosmesis. The aim of this study is to apply skin normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) optimization in left-side BC. Ten left-side BC patients undergoing photon irradiation after breast-conserving surgery were randomly selected from our clinical database. Intensity modulated photon (IMRT) and IMPT plans were calculated with iso-tumor-coverage criteria and according to RTOG 1005 guidelines. Proton plans were computed with and without skin optimization. Published NTCP models were employed to estimate the risk of different toxicity endpoints for skin, lung, heart and its substructures. Acute skin NTCP evaluation suggests a lower toxicity level with IMPT compared to IMRT when the skin is included in proton optimization strategy (0.1% versus 1.7%, p?<?0.001). Dosimetric results show that, with the same level of tumor coverage, IMPT attains significant heart and lung dose sparing compared with IMRT. By NTCP model-based analysis, an overall reduction in the cardiopulmonary toxicity risk prediction can be observed for all IMPT compared to IMRT plans: the relative risk reduction from protons varies between 0.1 and 0.7 depending on the considered toxicity endpoint. Our analysis suggests that IMPT might be safely applied without increasing the risk of severe acute radiation induced skin toxicity. The quantitative risk estimates also support the potential clinical benefits of IMPT for left-side BC irradiation due to lower risk of cardiac and pulmonary morbidity. The applied approach might be relevant on the long term for the setup of cost-effectiveness evaluation strategies based on NTCP predictions.",skin_neoplasms

However, fear and misconceptions drive avoidance of palliative care. Drawing from an empowerment perspective, we examined whether educating patients about evidence from the Early Palliative Care Study would increase preferences for palliative care. A sample of 598 patients with prostate, breast, lung, colon/rectal, skin, and other cancer diagnoses completed an Internet-mediated experiment using a between-group prepost design. Intervention participants received a summary of the Early Palliative Care Study; controls received no intervention. Participants completed baseline and posttest assessments of preferences of palliative care. Analyses controlled for age, gender, education, cancer type, presence of metastases, time since diagnosis, and baseline preferences. As hypothesized, the intervention had a favorable impact on participants' preferences for outpatient palliative cancer care relative to controls (d = 1.01, p < .001), while controlling for covariates. Intervention participants came to view palliative care as more efficacious (d = 0.79, p < .001) and less scary (d = 0.60, p < .001) and exhibited stronger behavioral intentions to utilize outpatient palliative care if referred (d = 0.60, p < .001). Findings were comparable in patients with metastatic disease, those with less education, and those experiencing financial strain. Educating patients about the Early Palliative Care Study increases preferences for early outpatient palliative care. This research has implications for future studies aimed at improving quality of life in cancer by increasing palliative care utilization. (PsycINFO Database Record",skin_neoplasms

A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was undertaken to evaluate the effect of scalp cooling versus no scalp cooling on the risk of scalp metastasis in patients treated for breast cancer with chemotherapy. Electronic databases, journal specific, and hand searches of articles identified were searched. Patients were matched based on disease, treatment, lack of metastatic disease, and sex. A total of 24 full-text articles were identified for review. Of these articles, ten quantified the incidence of scalp metastasis with scalp cooling over time. For scalp cooling, 1959 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 43.1?months. For no scalp cooling, 1238 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 87.4?months.

28274513,"PCTAIRE1 (also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (Cdk16) and PCTK1) is a Cdk family protein that has been implicated in spermatogenesis. We recently revealed the function of PCTAIRE1 in the tumorigenesis of malignancies, including breast and prostate cancers; however, the tumorigenic function of PCTAIRE1 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of PCTAIRE1 in the tumorigenesis of cutaneous SCCs. In cutaneous/oral SCC A431, DJM-1, HSC-3 cells, PCTAIRE1 gene-knockdown was found to diminish cell proliferation as assessed by cell counting and clonogenic assays. FACS analyses of annexin V-PI staining and DNA content showed PCTAIRE1 knockdown to cause G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis. The depletion of PCTAIRE1 was found to lead to the accumulation of tumor suppressor p27 and down-regulation of c-Myc. In tumor xenografts of A431 cells, the conditional knockdown of PCTAIRE1 restores p27 protein expression and suppresses tumor growth. Clinically, in primary tumors from patients with SCC, PCTAIRE1 is more highly expressed in malignant lesions than in adjacent normal epidermis. Conversely, expression levels of p27 are significantly lower in SCC than in normal epidermis. Our findings reveal a crucial function for PCTAIRE1 in regulating p27, c-Myc levels and tumor growth in cutaneous SCC cells, suggesting that PCTAIRE1 could be a novel target for skin tumor treatment.",skin_neoplasms

This retrospective review of medical records included 412 OTRs treated from November 1, 2011, through April 22, 2016, at an academic referral center. Prevalence and characteristics of cutaneous disease were compared in 154 white and 258 nonwhite (ie, Asian, Hispanic, and black) OTRs. Clinical factors of cutaneous disease and other common diagnoses assessed in OTRs included demographic characteristics, frequency and type of cancer, anatomical location, time course, sun exposure, risk awareness, and preventive behavior. Primary diagnosis of malignant or premalignant, infectious, and inflammatory disease. The 412 patients undergoing analysis included 264 men (64.1%) and 148 women (35.9%), with a mean age of 60.1 years (range, 32.1-94.3 years). White OTRs more commonly had malignant disease at their first visit (82 [67.8%]), whereas nonwhite OTRs presented more commonly with infectious (63 [37.5%]) and inflammatory (82 [48.8%]) conditions. Skin cancer was diagnosed in 64 (41.6%) white OTRs and 15 (5.8%) nonwhite OTRs. Most lesions in white (294 of 370 [79.5%]) and Asian (5 of 6 [83.3%]) OTRs occurred in sun-exposed areas. Among black OTRs, 6 of 9 lesions (66.7%) occurred in sun-protected areas, specifically the genitals.

The primary end point was the incidence of somatic mutations of the RAS, BRAF, and EGFR genes and association of cetuximab efficacy with these mutations was investigated by using Fisher test. Secondary end points were the disease control rate (DCR) at week 6, the progression free-survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile of cetuximab. Thirty-one samples of cSCC from 31 patients were analyzed. Only 2 RAS mutated samples (6.5%) were identified. The first harbored a NRAS point mutation (c.35G>A) in codon 12, resulting in a p.G12D substitution. The second sample presented a HRAS point mutation (c.38G>T) in codon 13, resulting in a p.G13V substitution. No mutation of KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR genes at the investigated loci was found. Two patients with NRAS and HRAS mutations showed a partial and complete response to cetuximab, respectively. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. At week 6, the disease control rate was 67.8%. The median OS was 13 months and the median PFS was 9 months. All patients could continue cetuximab treatment without dose reduction. Even in elderly patients with advanced cSCC, cetuximab was efficacious and well-tolerated. This suggests that cetuximab is certainly warranted in the treatment of advanced cSCC. However, it is also important to identify tumor specific mutations that may determine response to treatment and prognosis for the disease. We have identified here that the incidence of RAS, BRAF, and EGFR mutations is low in cSCC.",skin_neoplasms
28258767,"Primary melanoma of the external ear (PMEE) is rare and therefore well-suited for large population-based registry analysis. The objective of this study was to utilize the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) set of cancer registries to determine the incidence, treatment, and survival characteristics of PMEE. A retrospective cohort analysis of SEER data from 2004 to 2013 identified all cases of PMEE stage I-IV by AJCC 7th edition guidelines. Population-based incidence was calculated. Cancer-specific survival data by stage was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the relative effects of tumor characteristics were analyzed with Cox regression models. A total of 5481 patients were analyzed (mean age 66.7years, 86.5% male, 93.6% non-Hispanic white). The incidence of PMEE was 1.91 per 100,000 persons-per-year. At diagnosis, 68.1% were stage I, 15.2% were stage II, 4.7% were stage III, 1.5% were stage IV, and 10.8% were unknown. The five-year overall and cancer-specific survival was 78.8% and 90.0%, and, according to AJCC stage, was 85.7% and 95.3% for stage I (n=2287), 64.6% and 81.1% for stage II (n=453), 50.8% and 57.0% for stage III (n=154), 17.2% and 20.5% for stage IV (n=34), and 71.0% and 87.1% for unknown stage (n=330), respectively. The multivariable Cox model identified tumor characteristics that were independently associated with survival. This is the first study to characterize the epidemiology, presentation and outcome of PMEE using the SEER registries. Older age, increasing Breslow thickness, stage, presence of ulceration, positive lymph nodes and distant metastasis each independently predicted time to cancer-specific death.",skin_neoplasms
28257944,"Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive light based therapy used to treat non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and dysplasia. During PDT, the light sensitive molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is activated, resulting in the production of singlet oxygen, which subsequently leads to cell death. PpIX is metabolised from a topically applied pro-drug and the strong fluorescence signal associated with PpIX can be utilised as an indicator of the amount of PpIX present within the tumour tissue. In this work we measure the build up PpIX during the occlusive treatment phase and investigate how the PpIX production rate is affected by different lesion and patient characteristics. Fluorescence measurements were used to investigate the build up of PpIX within the tumour tissue during the 3h long occlusive treatment prior to irradiation. The study included in vivo measurements of 38 lesions from 38 individual patients. Actinic keratosis (AK) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were the lesion types included in this study. The resulting data from the study was analysed using generalised linear mixed effects models. It was found that the surface fluorescence signal linearly increased with occlusive treatment time. The predictive models suggest that there is a significant difference in PpIX production between lesion location, however no significant difference is demonstrated between different lesion types, gender and skin type. The study extends and supports previous knowledge of PpIX production during the occlusive treatment phase.",skin_neoplasms

Positive attitudes and beliefs about sun safety behavior, which would make sun protective behavior more likely, could be promoted and supported by school policies and practices. To identify school characteristics associated with having adopted practices that promote sun safety. School-level data from the February 3 to July 23, 2014, School Health Policies and Practices Study's Healthy and Safe School Environment questionnaire were analyzed. The School Health Policies and Practices Study uses a 2-stage sampling design to select a nationally representative sample of schools. All public, state-administered, Catholic, and non-Catholic private schools with any of the grades from kindergarten through 12 were eligible for inclusion. All analyses were conducted using weighted data. Prevalence of sun safety practices. In a nationally representative sample of 828 US schools, representatives of 577 schools (69.7%) responded. Overall, sun safety practices were not common among schools. The most frequent practice was having teachers allow time for students to apply sunscreen at school (47.6%; 95% CI, 42.4%-52.9%). Few schools made sunscreen available for students to use (13.3%; 95% CI, 10.2%-17.0%), almost always or always scheduled outdoor activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak intensity (15.0%; 95% CI, 11.4%-19.6%), or asked parents to ensure that students applied sunscreen before school (16.4%; 95% CI, 12.9%-20.6%). High schools were less likely than elementary schools and middle schools to adopt several practices: for instance, 37.5% of high schools (95% CI, 29.7%-46.0%), 51.6% of middle schools (95% CI, 43.3%-59.7%), and 49.5% of elementary schools (95% CI, 42.0%-57.0%) had teachers allow time for students to apply sunscreen at school, and 11.8% of high schools (95% CI, 7.7%-17.5%), 18.2% of middle schools (95% CI, 13.3%-24.4%), and 14.7% of elementary schools (95% CI, 9.6%-21.8%) almost always or always scheduled outdoor activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak intensity. Other school characteristics were either not significantly associated with the adoption of any of the sun safety school practices studied (eg, metropolitan status) or were inconsistently associated with such policies and practices (eg, region, percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and school enrollment). School practices that could protect children and adolescents from sun exposure and that could change norms about sun safety are not common. Interventions aimed at increasing the adoption of sun safety practices among schools are needed regardless of the level, location, size, and poverty concentration of the school. Such practices would cost little to implement and would support other messages targeted toward children, adolescents, adults, and parents, with an aim to reduce skin cancer morbidity and mortality.",skin_neoplasms
28253523,"Primary melanoma of the CNS in children is extremely rare, and usually linked to congenital melanocytic naevus syndrome, caused by mosaicism for oncogenic NRAS mutations. Outcome is fatal in all cases. Data from murine and in vitro studies suggest that MEK inhibition is a possible therapeutic option. Four children with NRAS-mutated CNS melanoma were treated with Trametinib on a compassionate basis. All four had an improvement in symptoms and objectively in signs. These varied from mild improvement for 1 month, to a sustained symptom-free period of 9 months in one case. In all cases there was eventual disease progression through treatment, followed by rapid death after discontinuation. There were no clinically-significant side effects. Trametinib is the first therapy to show any objective or measurable effect in NRAS-mutated primary CNS melanoma, with few side effects in this small series.

We conducted a retrospective review of 80 patients treated for regionally metastatic cutaneous HNSCC. The effect of various clinicopathologic variables on overall survival (OS) was investigated, in addition to outcomes by treatment modality. On multivariate regression, cutaneous primary >2 cm (p = .03) and extracapsular spread (ECS; p = .01) were significantly associated with decreased OS. Location of regional metastasis (neck vs parotid vs both) had no effect on OS (p = .2), nor did the presence of a cutaneous primary at the time of presentation (p = .9). The 3-year survival was 43%, 52%, and 49% for surgery alone, adjuvant radiation, and adjuvant chemoradiation, respectively. Fifty-one percent of patients had a recurrence of their disease. Regionally metastatic cutaneous HNSCC is an aggressive disease associated with high recurrence rates.

Several reports suggest that the incidence of basal cell carcinoma is increased in DM1. However, two recently published studies examining this topic have contradictory results. To retrospectively study the incidence of cutaneous tumours in patients with DM1. The clinical features of 102 Caucasian patients diagnosed with DM1 at Bellvitge Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, were retrospectively analysed. Clinical charts of the patients were reviewed, and cutaneous tumours diagnosed in our hospital were recorded. A group of 103 Caucasian patients matched for age and sex were used as the control group. A total of 56 male and 46 female patients with DM1 were included in the study (mean age 49.07 years, SD 13.02). At least 1 basal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 6 patients in the DM1 group versus 3 patients in the control group (p = 0.332). The mean age at diagnosis of the first basal cell carcinoma was 51 years compared with 66 years in the control group (p = 0.035). Five patients with DM1 presented pilomatrixomas versus none in the control group (p = 0.029). We did not detect any melanoma in our DM1 patients. Basal cell carcinomas appeared at a significantly younger age in our DM1 patients than in the general population, and this suggests that, at least in some patients, DM1 may predispose to the development of basal cell carcinomas.",skin_neoplasms
28249100,"Follicular tumors and cysts are common skin lesions in dogs. Both are distinguished based on their cellular origin (matrical, isthmus, or infundibular cells) and the type of keratin they produce. Typically, differentiation requires histopathology, as all these lesions often have similar cytologic features. The goal of this retrospective study was to identify unique cytologic features that may assist differentiation of canine benign follicular tumors and cysts at cytology, using histopathology as gold standard. Electronic medical records of the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were searched for diagnoses of follicular tumors and cysts in dogs that had both histopathologic and cytologic diagnoses between January 2000 and December 2013. Cytologic specimens were reassessed in a blinded manner for the presence and type of background, cells, noncellular elements, and inflammation. Forty-six samples were included in the study. Follicular cysts (n = 25) and infundibular keratinizing acanthomas (n = 5) contained sheets of keratinized anucleate to nucleated squamous cells. Trichoepitheliomas (n = 8) had 2 primary cytologic presentations: those with primarily basaloid cells that appeared to be undergoing keratinization (3/8; 38%) and those with keratinizing anucleate to nucleated squamous cells (5/8; 63%). Trichoblastomas (n = 8) had pink matrix with spindle cells and contained cohesive clusters of basaloid cells. Trichoblastomas, and to a lesser extent, trichoepitheliomas, have unique cytologic features with the potential to distinguish them from other benign follicular tumors and cysts. These results are an important first step toward improving the diagnostic specificity of cytologic examination of cutaneous follicular lesions.",skin_neoplasms

28245323,"Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in subsequent neoplasm risk. To quantify the association between temporal changes in treatment dosing and subsequent neoplasm risk. Retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 5-year cancer survivors diagnosed before age 21 years from pediatric tertiary hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970-1999, with follow-up through December 2015. Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time. Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios for subsequent malignancies, compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Among 23?603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374?638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P?<?.001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P?=?.03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P?<?.001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower risk was associated with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.",skin_neoplasms

The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable.

More data on these screening programs are needed. To describe a skin cancer screening quality initiative in a large health care system and to determine if the intervention was associated with screening of a demographically higher-risk population than previous screening programs and if melanoma incidence and thickness differed in screened vs unscreened patients. This observational evaluation of a prospectively implemented quality initiative was conducted in a large health care system in western Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, UPMC) among adults seen in an office visit by a UPMC-employed primary care physician (PCP) in 2014.

The origin of the superficial circumflex iliac artery, the origin of the medial perforator, the location where it penetrates the deep fascia, and its pattern of pathway after penetration of the superficial fascia were evaluated. There was 100 percent correlation between computed tomographic angiogram and surgical findings. The superficial circumflex iliac artery originates mostly from the femoral artery in 84.8 percent. The medial perforator originated from the superficial circumflex iliac artery in 94 percent. The medial perforator typically penetrated the deep fascia within an oval of 4.2 ¡¿ 2 cm located 4.5 cm lateral and 1.5 cm superior from the pelvic tubercle. After passing the superficial fascia, the medial perforator either anchored directly into skin (56 percent) or traveled in an axial pattern (44 percent) beyond the anterior superior iliac spine. Despite the origin of the medial perforator, it was constantly observed penetrating the deep fascia. However, the pathway of the medial perforator can be either anchoring directly into the dermis or extending as an axial pattern artery, implicating a different effect on the survival of the flap.

28228113,"Knowledge of the genotype of melanoma is important to guide patient management. Identification of mutations in BRAF and c-KIT lead directly to targeted treatment, but it is also helpful to know if there are driver oncogene mutations in NRAS, GNAQ or GNA11 as these patients may benefit from alternative strategies such as immunotherapy. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are often used to detect BRAF mutations, next generation sequencing (NGS) is able to determine all of the necessary information on several genes at once, with potential advantages in turnaround time. We describe here an Ampliseq hotspot panel for melanoma for use with the IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) which covers the mutations currently of most clinical interest. We have validated this in 151 cases of skin and uveal melanoma from our files, and correlated the data with PCR based assessment of BRAF status. There was excellent agreement, with few discrepancies, though NGS does have greater coverage and picks up some mutations that would be missed by PCR. However, these are often rare and of unknown significance for treatment. PCR methods are rapid, less time-consuming and less expensive than NGS, and could be used as triage for patients requiring more extensive diagnostic workup. The NGS panel described here is suitable for clinical use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples.",skin_neoplasms

A prospective, multicenter, cohort study of cancer patients with PICC insertion was performed from February 1, 2013 to April 24, 2014. All patients were monitored in clinic until PICCs were removed. The primary endpoint was PICC removal due to complications. Patient-, catheter- and insertion-related factors were analyzed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant independent risk factors for PICC-related complications. There were 477 cancer patients included, for a total of 50,841 catheter-days. Eighty-one patients (17.0%) developed PICC-related complications, with an incidence of 1.59 per 1000 catheter days. Thirty-six (7.5%) PICCs were removed because of complications. The most common complications were skin allergy (4.6%), catheter occlusion (3.4%) and accidental withdrawal (2.3%). Nine (1.9%) patients developed symptomatic upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) and central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) was shown in six (1.3%) PICCs with an infection rate 0.12 per 1000 catheter days.

The deformity resulting from ablative procedures of the head and neck is a significant source of cosmetic morbidity and postoperative dissatisfaction. Reconstruction of post-ablative defects in the head and neck can employ a broad range of techniques, ranging from primary closure to free tissue transfer. The free dermal fat graft (FDFG) is one such option and has been used to repair volume defects of varying sizes after common head and neck procedures such as parotidectomy. However, its use is largely undocumented in the literature. We seek to further illustrate the FDFG as an alternate method of reconstruction of head and neck defects. Non-randomized retrospective analysis. The medical records of all patients who underwent primary autologous abdominal FDFG reconstruction of head and neck defects by a single surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from January 1997 to August 2010 were reviewed. All patients were called in order to assess their post-operative cosmetic satisfaction. Sixty-two patients were analyzed. Only three patients were found to have post-operative complications directly related to the FDFG. No complications were found at the donor site. Based on a telephone survey, the majority of patients were satisfied post-operatively with their cosmetic outcomes in the primary site and donor site.

Tissue Inhibitor of Metlloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) is a matrix associated endogenous inhibitor of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). Cancer metastasis occurs as a result of imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs. TIMP-3 is involved significantly in regulation of MMPs as well as progression of canine mammary tumor. The present study was conducted to identify the structural and functional relationship between TIMP-3 and MMP which can aid in identifying the role of these proteins in canine mammary tumor. Molecular characterization of TIMP-3 protein was done by molecular biology techniques such as gene cloning and sequencing. The homology based model of TIMP-3 protein was created and verified with a variety of available computational techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulation. The results indicated that predicted TIMP-3 protein structure of Canis lupus familiaris was reliable and more stable. The docking of TIMP-3 protein with MMP-2 and MMP-9 represents conformational structure of these two proteins which interact with each other but if misled canresult in the progression of tumor in canine. The three dimensional structure of TIMP-3 was generated and its interactions with MMP-2 and MMP-9, demonstrates the role of key binding residues.

The objective of the present study was to examine the potential advantages of fluorescence-guided SLNB - compared to the conventional method - with respect to the visualization of lymphatic drainage pathways and the SLN. Particular focus was on the impact of the ICG dose used and the body mass index (BMI). The study included ten patients who underwent the SLNB procedure using technetium-99m, blue dye, and ICG. Real-time fluorescence imaging of lymphatic drainage pathways and the SLN was done using the ""FOVIS""-NIR system. Depending on the quality of the images achieved, ICG was intradermally administered at a dose ranging from 0.25 to 2.5?mg. Nine SLNs were identified by fluorescence (90?%); (100?%) ten, by gamma probe; eight (80?%), by ICG or blue dye. Transdermal SLN detection was possible in one case (10 %). In correlation to the BMI, higher intradermal ICG doses - up to 2.5?mg overall - proved to be advantageous in the visualization of lymphatic vessels.

Patients who experienced mastectomy flap necrosis following mastectomy with tissue expander placement between January 2009 and March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was explantation of the expander, and other associated outcomes such as seroma or infection were also recorded. A total of 57 breasts with mastectomy flap necrosis were identified: 32 of which were in the non-ADM group and 25 in the ADM group. The rate of explantation was 28% (7/25) in the ADM group versus 6.3% (2/32) in the non-ADM group, which was significantly different (P?=?0.034). The ADM group had a significantly higher rate of ""major"" infection requiring surgical debridement than the non-ADM group (P?=?0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that the use of ADM was trending toward an increasing expander rate with borderline significance (P?=?0.05).

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine was well tolerated by both patients and had no adverse effects. A reduction of SCCs and BCCs was observed in 2 patients after administration of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. These findings highlight the possibility that cutaneous SCC development, and perhaps BCC development, may be driven in part by HPV in immunocompetent patients. Human papillomavirus vaccination may represent an efficacious, cost-effective, readily available, and well-tolerated strategy for preventing KCs.",skin_neoplasms
28195888,"Monitoring the viability of buried free flaps in hypopharyngeal reconstruction is difficult. Various methods have been proposed to monitor these buried flaps, but limitations remain. We present a method of using double-paddle chimeric peroneal flaps that permanently externalizes a flap skin paddle as a monitoring paddle in hypopharyngeal reconstructions. This study was performed in a medical center in southern Taiwan; between 2013 and 2015, 10 patients underwent double-paddle chimeric peroneal flap reconstruction in advanced stages of hypopharyngeal cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records from these surgeries, searching for either short-term postoperative complications or long-term follow-up morbidity and researched relevant articles for comparisons with other monitoring methods. None of the 10 flaps underwent total loss. The rate of stenosis and that of fistula formation was 10%. The average postoperative hospital stay was 39 days. Six of 10 patients were able to resume at least a soft diet after reconstruction, and none of the patients experienced significant complications. The peroneal flap is a useful flap because it is thin and pliable, has minimal donor site morbidity in patients without peripheral vascular disease, and has the potential of multiple skin paddles so that one skin paddle can be used for monitoring the buried flap. Using this method, direct clinical monitoring is feasible, and early detection of vascular complications is possible. Furthermore, the drawbacks of using a monitoring paddle produced by a deepithelialized bridge can be avoided.",skin_neoplasms
28194796,"Prior radiotherapy leads to increased wound complication rates for microsurgical reconstruction of pharyngolaryngeal (PL) defects. Incorporating vastus lateralis muscle together with anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) skin in defect reconstruction is useful in protecting vital structures and reinforcing irradiated neck skin and suture lines. This study shows the utility of the musculocutaneous ALT (MC ALT) in PL reconstruction in previously irradiated patients. A single-surgeon, retrospective chart review of all patients with defects of the PL region where an MC ALT was used for reconstruction from February 2014 to May 2016. The harvest of the MC ALT is described. Thirteen consecutive patients underwent reconstruction with a MC ALT flap. All 13 patients had received previous radiotherapy. PL defects included five partial, five subtotal, and three total. There was a 100% flap survival rate with five early recipient site complications including three fistulas, one neck abscess, and one partial muscle necrosis. Three patients (23%) developed strictures requiring dilatation, two of whom had received post-reconstruction radiotherapy. The use of the MC ALT for reconstruction of PL defects should be considered to mitigate the negative effects of prior irradiation and provide a back-up plan in instances where complications occur.",skin_neoplasms
28191631,"Erythroderma is a serious medical condition characterized by inflamed red skin involving over 90% of the body. It can be the common presentation of different diseases, therefore clinical diagnosis can be problematic. Controversial data are reported regarding the diagnostic value of histological examination in erythroderma subjects. A retrospective study was performed, investigating histological skin specimens of patients with a clinical diagnosis of erythroderma admitted to the Department of Dermatology of State Pediatric Medical University, Saint Petersburg, from 2001 to 2014. Histopathology examination was performed in each case by a pathologist with a special interest in the skin disease who was blind to any clinical information as well as to final diagnosis. Blinded histopathology examination alone was able to give the correct diagnosis in 61% (n = 50/82) of cases when compared to final diagnosis. A diagnosis of psoriasis was made in 23.2% (n = 19/82) of subjects, spongiotic dermatitis/eczema in 20.7% (n = 17/82), mycosis fungoides in 8.5% (n = 7/82), and drug eruption in 8.5%; histological diagnosis was inconclusive or not matching the final diagnosis when available in the remaining 39.1% of cases (n = 32/82). Erythroderma remains a condition difficult to study and treat. We showed that a correct judgment about its cause can be based on objective histopathological criteria in up to 60% of cases. More studies are needed to try to find out further histological and/or immunohistochemical markers that could help the clinician with the erythroderma etiology diagnostic process.",skin_neoplasms
28190256,"Recent studies have evaluated the expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its prognostic value in malignant T-cell lymphomas. This study investigated whether the positivity of PD-1 was associated with the clinical characteristics of cutaneous extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) and evaluated its effects on survival outcomes. Forty-one patients with cutaneous ENKTL were included. Clinical features and survival outcomes were analysed according to the positivity of PD-1. There was no significant difference between primary cutaneous ENKTL and secondary cutaneous ENKTL in the expression of PD-1. The degree of disease dissemination was not affected by the positivity of PD-1. Higher positivity for PD-1 was associated with lesions presenting erythematous to purpuric patches that are mainly composed of small tumour cells. Cutaneous ENKTL presenting nodular lesions had a significantly lower number of PD-1-positive infiltrating cells than those with other clinical morphologies. There was no significant effect of PD-1 expression on outcomes such as overall and progression-free survival. This study used a retrospective design and had a small sample size. Higher PD-1 positivity is associated with small-cell-predominant cutaneous ENKTL. However, PD-1 expression has no prognostic value in cutaneous ENKTL.",skin_neoplasms
28188628,"Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) for the treatment of melanoma has led to an important improvement of overall survival in advanced stage patients. However, secondary cutaneous maculopapular eruptions (CMPEs) are frequent and remain poorly characterized. We performed a retrospective analysis of melanoma patients from our institution who developed CMPEs during ICBT. Clinical information was retrieved, and histopathological and immunohistochemical characterization was performed by two pathologists. For comparison, a group of biopsies from CMPE caused by anti-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) therapy was analyzed. + cells were invariably present, and PD-1 was not expressed. Biopsies from CMPE caused by anti-BRAF therapy showed an SPLD and a similar lymphocytic immunophenotype. Our study showed the clinical features of a group of melanoma patients with CMPE for ICBT and emphasized the wide spectrum of histological findings as well as their immunohistochemical profile. Differential diagnosis can be difficult with CMPE provoked by other therapies as was seen in our comparison group of anti-BRAF-induced eruptions.",skin_neoplasms
28187958,"A variety of cancers are associated with the expression of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster (Oncomir-1) and tumor suppressor miR-143-5p/miR-145-5p. Epidermal skin cancer has not been investigated for the expression of miR-17-92 and miR-143-145 clusters, despite being extensively studied regarding global microRNA profiles. The goal of this study was to investigate the expression and possible correlation of expression of miR17-92 and miR-143-145 cluster members in epidermal skin cancer. We evaluated punch biopsies from patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC, n=15) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC, n=16), along with control specimens from non-lesional epidermal skin (n=16). Expression levels of the miR17-92 cluster (including miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a-3p, miR-18a-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-19a-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-19b-1-5p, miR-20a-3p, miR-20a-5p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-92a-5p) and the tumor-suppressive cluster miR-143-145 (including miR-143-5p and miR-145-5p) were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We noted a highly significant increased expression of the miR-17-92 members miR-17-5p, miR-18a-5p, miR19a-3p, and miR-19b-3p and tumor suppressor miR-143-5p (p<0.01) in cSCC. miR-145-5p had a significantly decreased expression (p<0.05) for in BCC. A correlation analysis revealed multiple correlating miRNA-pairs within and between the investigated clusters. This study marks the first evidence for the participation of members of the miR-17-92 cluster in cSCC and miR-143-145 cluster in BCC.",skin_neoplasms
28183159,"Several accelerated partial breast radiation (APBR) techniques have been investigated in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC); however, the optimal treatment delivery techniques remain unclear. We evaluated the feasibility and toxicity of APBR delivered using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in elderly patients with stage I BC, using a novel fractionation schedule. Forty-two patients aged ¡Ã65 years, with stage I BC who underwent breast conserving surgery were enrolled in a phase I/II study evaluating APBR using IMRT. Forty eligible patients received 40 Gy in 4 Gy daily fractions. Patients were assessed for treatment related toxicities, and cosmesis, before APBR, during, and after completion of the treatment. The median age was 73 years, median tumor size 0.8 cm and the median follow-up was 54 months. The 5-year locoregional control was 97.5% and overall survival 90%.

28181826,"To describe a new technique to prevent skin laceration during ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy with the insertion of a spinal needle between the mass and the skin. The study includes 118 patients with 118 breast imaging-reporting and data system Category 3 masses located very close to the skin or areola, which were excised using the mammotome system with a spinal needle inserted just above the site of insertion of the probe. The mean distance between the most superficial portion of the mass to the under surface of the overlying skin was 1.3 ¡¾ 0.4?mm. The average procedure time was 13.5 ¡¾ 4.2?min. A complete excision was achieved in 100% of the cases, and the procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. No patient experienced serious adverse events such as a skin laceration. This is the first study to prevent skin laceration during vacuum assisted breast biopsy. Advances in knowledge: The method described in this study is simple, safe and well tolerated by patients.",skin_neoplasms
